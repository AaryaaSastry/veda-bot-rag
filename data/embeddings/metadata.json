    "text": " the quest of man to have a happy life, through a deep understanding \nof evolution, creation and its maintenance, perceived and conceived by the rishi’s of ancient India. The \nprogressive establishment of scientific Ayurveda began in the Vedic period and has defined life as a manifestation \nof union of soul, mind and body those are integral and interdependent components of life. Ahara (wholesome \nfood), nidra (Optimum sleep) and brahmacharya (selective Celibacy) has been given pivotal role in the \nmaintenance of health. Along with diet, dinacharya and rtucharya has been given important role in the \nmaintenance of disease. Ayurveda describes the wholesome and non-wholesome substances including diet, \nmedicines etc. and has classified them into three major categories, viz, Shamana (palliative), Kopana \n(aggravating) and Swastha Hita (conducive to health).\nHuman body develops by assimilating nutrients from food. Wholesome food is the cause for excellence in \nhealth and unwholesome is responsible for disease. Ayurveda has developed the wisdom of dietetics on the \nbasis of various natural perceptions at different levels of our sensorium. Ahara (wholesome food), Vihara \n(wholesome activities) and Aushadha (medicaments) form the cornerstone of palliative treatment.\nAnatomy and physiology of skin has been dealt in detail by Ayurveda. The diseases of skin often mirror the \nin-equilibrium of dosha in the body as skin represents the substratum upon which the quality of ahararasa, \nwhich is obtained from Ahara, is depicted upon. The ICD-10 classification of human disease lists more than\n1,000 skin or skin-related illnesses, a pattern dominated by a few conditions accounting for most of the skin \ndisease burden. Despite this profound impact, skin disease continues to receive relatively little attention in the \nnational or global health debate. Collectively, skin conditions were the 4th leading cause of nonfatal burden \nexpressed as years lost due to disability in 2010.\nAyurveda has included skin diseases under the umbrella of Kushta and has pointed at its multifactorial \netiology. Erroneous Diet and lifestyle have been implicated as chief factors for the onset, progression and \nrecurrence of many skin diseases.

Skin also regulates \nbody temperature, gathers sensory inputs from the environment, stores water, fat, and vitamin D, and plays a role in \nthe immune system protecting from the disease. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and protects the \nbody from the environment. The thickness of the epidermis varies in different types of skin; it is only .05 mm thick on \nthe eyelids, and is 1.5 mm thick on the palms and the soles of the feet. The dermis is located beneath the epidermis \nand is the thickest of the three layers of the skin (1.5 to 4 mm thick), making up approximately 90 percent of the \nthickness of the skin. The main functions of the dermis are to regulate teFmperature and to supply the epidermis with \nnutrient-saturated blood. Much of the body’s water supply is stored within the dermis. This layer contains most of the \nskins’ specialized cells and structures, including lymphatic’s, blood vessels, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, collagen, \nelastin and nerve endings. The hypodermis (subcutaneous layer, or superficial fascia) lies between the dermis and \nunderlying tissues and organs. It consists of mostly adipose tissue and is the storage site of most body fat.\nAyurveda explains twak as one among the 5 jnanendriya, attributed with the function of sensation of touch and is the \nlocation (ashray sthana) of sweat channels (swedavahi strotas) and hairs (loma). Susrutha and Bhavamishra'have \nopined that twak has 7 layers, while Vagbhatta and Charaka have described 6 layers of twak as tabulated below.\nTable 1: 7 layers of Twak (skin) as explained by Ayurveda.\nName of different \nLayer\nWidth\n(thickness)\nRogadhisthan \n(site of skin diseases)\nModern concept\nAvabhasini/\nUdakdhara\n1/18 vrihi\nSidhma, Padmakantaka\nEpithelial layer, horny \nlayer, Stratum \nCorneum\nLohita/Asrugdhara\n1/16 vrihi\nTilkalak, Nyachchha, Vyang\n",

Silently (moun)\n\nAhara matra (quantity of food)\nThe food and nutritional requirement varies from person to person and depends upon the status of agni, sharira \nprakriti, age etc. Susruta and Vagbhata have suggested that if stomach capacity is hypothetically divided into 4 \nparts on the basis of its filling , one should take 2 parts of solid food, 1 part of liquid food and 1 part should be \nleft empty for easy movement of Vata4.\nSequence of food intake\nGuru, madhura and snigdha food should be taken initially during the course of a meal followed by amla, lavana \nahara. Food which is ruksha, katu, tikta and kashaya should be taken in the last part of the meal for proper \nactivation of agni, proper absorption and assimilation of food. After taking food, it is advised to take rest for \nmuhurta matra (48 minutes)5 for proper digestion.\nAhara vidhi viseshaayatana\nTo receive the total benefits of Ahara it is also necessary to have the knowledge about” Ashta ahara \nvidhivisheshaayatana”.they are\n1. Prakriti-food should be taken considering the nature of food, such as guru (Heavy food like \nmilk, flesh), laghu (food like green gram etc which are light to digest) , seeta (food which are \ncold in potency such as milk) , ushna (food which are of hot potency like spicy food), ruksha \n(dry ness inducing food), snigda( unctuous food such as ghee, butter) and their impact on agni .\n2. Karana- It refers to modification in the food property by action of agni, water etc. dadhi is a \nsubstance which is prohibited to be used after heating.\n3.

Acharya Charaka \ndefines virudhahara as certain diet and its combinations, which interrupts the metabolism, which inhibits the process \nof formation of tissue and which have opposite property to that of the tissue are called as ViruddhaAnna or \nincompatible diet7. Virudha can be considered as diet which are having mutually contradictory properties, \ncontradictory to tissues, diet capable of producing untoward effect on the body when processed in a particular \nform or proportion or those food which may produce an unwanted effect when taken at an inappropriate time. \nAyurvedic literature has compiled almost 18 types of virudha ahara and has also mentioned complications ranging \nfrom skin diseases (kushta), visarpa (erysipelas), unmada (insanity) and marana (death).\nConcept of Vihara (Lifestyle) in Ayurveda\nThe description about Dinacharya, Rtucharya, Sadvrtta and Nidra in Ayurveda clearly depicts the importance of \na healthy regimen in the prevention and management of many diseases. A growing body of scientific evidence has \ndemonstrated that lifestyle intervention is an essential component in the treatment of chronic disease that can be as \neffective as medication but considered to be safe without risks and side effects8.

It not only cleanses the tongue but also stimulates appetite and \ndigestion. Mouth should also be cleaned properly.\n• \nEyes should be cleaned with fresh water to prevent eye diseases and promote vision. Also wash eyes with \nTriphala Phanta every day.\n• \nChewing ofbetel leaves with small pieces of Areca nut (kramuka) and fragrant substances like cardamom, \ncloves, refreshes the mouth and enhance digestion.\n• \nIt is necessary to massage whole body with oil every day. Oil massage ensures softness and unctuousness \nof skin, free movement ofjoints and muscles, peripheral circulation and elimination of metabolic wastes.\n• \nRegular exercise is essential for perfect health. It builds up stamina and resistance against disease, clears \nthe channels of body (Srotas) and increases the blood circulation. It enhances efficiency of body organs, \npromotes appetite and digestion and prevents obesity.\n• \nBathing improves enthusiasm, strength, sexual vigour, appetite, span of life and removes sweat and other \nimpurities from the body. After bath one should wear clean clothes and smear the body with perfume. \nOne should have regular shaving, haircut, cutting of nails etc.\n\n• \nPerson should avoid extra marital sexual relationship and sexual intercourse with a woman during her \nmenses, pregnancy, within one and half month after delivery, devoid of passion, older than one and \nsuffering from disease.\nRitucharya (Seasonal regimen)\nIn Ayurvedic classics",

Whole year is divided into six seasons and detailed dietetic regimen for these seasons is prescribed. In \nspring season, bitter, hot and astringent diet is advised while salty, sour and sweet food should be avoided. \nWheat, barley, honey syrup, fruits like mango, jack fruit-etc. and meat of forest animals is advised. In summer \nseason due to hot climate aggravation ofpitta occurs. Hence pitta pacifying cold, liquid, sweet and oily diet is \nadvised. Excessive hot, spicy, sour salty diet should be avoided. Intake of rice, milk, ghee, sugar, grapes, coconut \nwater, meat of forest animals are advised. In rainy season aggravation of vata occurs, hence vata shamaka \nsweet, sour and salty food and drinks are preferred. The food should be hot, dry, fatty and easily digestible. \nPreserved rice, wheat, barley and mutton soups are advised. In pre winter and winter season Vatadosha aggravates \ndue to cold, dry, chily atmosphere hence vataghna, pittavardhaka diet is recommended. Hot, sweet, sour and \nsalty food, milk, sugarcane, rice, oils and fats are advised and in autumn season aggravation of Pitta dosha \noccurs. Therefore, it is ideal to take ghee processed with bitter drugs; purgation, bloodletting, coolant, and light \ndiet are advised. Diets dominant in Bitter, sweet, pungent diets are advised.\nSadvritta (Ethical Regimen): Rules of good conduct\nAyurveda prescribes certain rules for maintaining healthy mind. These are principles of right conduct that are \napplicable to all people at all times and places. Practicing them gives balance and harmony to the mind. These are\n• \nAlways speak the truth.\n• \nDo not lose your temper under any circumstances.\n• \nDo not get addicted to sensory pleasures.\n• \nDo not harm anyone.\n• \nAs far as possible, do not expose yourself to hardships.\n• \nTry to control your passions.\n•",

Ayurveda has given prime importance to ahara and vihara in the maintenance of health \nand prevention of diseases. In the recent past the relation between diet and skin ailments is well established in \ncontemporary medicine. Ayurvedic literature has described skin diseases mainly under the spectrum of kushta, \nthe literary meaning of which is that which cause disfiguration.\nAyurvedic system of medicine describes a wide range of etiological factors for dermatological disorders. The \netiological factors include physical, physiological, psychological, psychosocial, hereditary and Papakarma (sinful \nactivities), based on the proximity of causes which are reclassified into sannikrishta (proximal cause) and viprakrishta \n(remote cause) nidana\nSannikrista Nidana (real causative factor) - Three Doshas viz. Vata, Pitta and Kapha and four Dushyas viz. \nTvak (Rasa), Rakta, Mansa and Ambu or Lasika involved in the pathogenesis of skin diseases. These seven can \nbe considered as sannikrishta nidana in kushta",

Ill effect is thought to be transmigrated \nfrom past lives (Poorva Janmakrata)\nAccording to Sushruta if the person suffered from Kushtha in his previous life and if he takes rebirth then he \ndevelops Kushtha in his present life also Papakarma (sinful activities) has also been implicated in the etiology of \nkushta and is also said as a samsargja vyadhi (communicable disease). The Kushtha is generally described as \nTridoshaja Vyadhi but type of the Kushtha ascertained upon the predominance of particular Dosha and is generally \nclassified into mahakushta and ksudra kushta.\n\nNidana or the etiological factors closely linked with the manifestation, transmission and progression \nof the disease are broadly classified in the classical Ayurveda texts in the following categories:\n1. Aharaja nidana- food related causes\n2. Viharaja Nidana- regimen related causes\n3. Manasika Nidana- psychological causes.\n4. Visesha Nidana- an etiology that is not common in all diseases, but specifically act as hetu in this \ndisease.\n5.

These evidences are further expanded and documented as \nclassical texts of Ayurveda such as Charaka Samhita, Susrutha Samhita, Astanga Sangraha etc. \nFurther in the medieval period, several new classics such as Bhavaprakasha, Shamgdhara \nSamhita, Chakradatta etc have expanded the scope, emphasizing on prevention and management \nof diseases through dietary and preventive interventions.\nAyurveda vividly describes the conducive and non-conducive substances including diet, \nmedicines etc and has classified them into three major categories, viz, Shamana (palliative), \nKopana (aggravating) and Swastha Hita (conducive to health). Ayurveda has also emphasized on \nthree major factors responsible for causation of any illness such as Asatmyendriyartha Samyoga \n(incompatible correlation of sense organs), Prajnaparadha (intellectual blasphemy) and \nParinama (disharmony with rhythms and cycles of nature); avoidance of which is essential for \nmaintenance of health and prevention of diseases.\nDetailed description concerning functional anatomy and physiology of Hridaya and associated \nillnesses are available in Ayurvedic literature.

Background\nThe incidence of lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, \nand overweight/obesity associated with cardiovascular diseases is on the rise. Cardiovascular \ndisorders continue to be the major cause of mortality representing about 30% of all deaths \nworldwide. With rapid economic development and increasing urbanization of lifestyle in the past \nfew decades, prevalence of these diseases has reached alarming proportions among Indians in the \nrecent years. As Ayurveda is recognized as foremost life science and describes ways to prevent \nand manage lifestyle disorders, the world is being attracted towards its potential. Ayurveda \nprovides effective solutions in the forms of dietary regulation, lifestyle advisory, detoxification \nand bio-purification procedures like Panchakarma, since it targets preventive, palliative \nrejuvenative interventions and medicaments. The holistic approach of Ayurveda, treating the \npatient as a whole, meaning intervention targeted towards complete physical, psychological, \nand spiritual well-being makes this science a wonderful option in lifestyle disorders.\nBasically in Ayurveda, promotion of health and prevention of diseases is given more \nimportance than the treatment of the diseases. Health and diseases is dependent on three factors\n1.e. Ahara (Diet), Vihara (life style practices) & Oushadha (Drug& therapies). Among these, \nfood (Ahara) is considered as most important one. Pathya is defined as the ahara (diet) which \nis congenial to a person according to his constitution, appetite & digestive capacity of the body. \nMost health problems develop due to the wrong eating and improper cooking. The planning \nof diet, based on certain principles mentioned in Astavid",

    "text": ") which \nis congenial to a person according to his constitution, appetite & digestive capacity of the body. \nMost health problems develop due to the wrong eating and improper cooking. The planning \nof diet, based on certain principles mentioned in Astavidhi vishesayatan is very rational and \nscientific. Ayurveda emphasizes the characteristics of food in terms of quality, quantity and time \nwhich vary with age, constitution, habitat, digestive power, season, disease and also liking of \nthe patient. One has to consume the diet, which is suitable to him in all aspects, and deviation \nfrom these may cause diseases. In addition to these, wrong cooking procedures, irregular timing, \nand consuming imbalanced and non-congenial food and not following the prescribed rules for \npreparing, preserving and eating food may also cause imbalance of health. The proper intake \nof diet not only can prevent many health disorders but also plays major role in the management \nof diseases. Therefore, due consideration should be given to all aspects of diet- planning for \ntreatment of diseases and to maintain the health, according to Ayurveda.\nThe Ayurvedic regime of healthy life is designed for achievement of a long, healthy \nactive life, providing relief from pain and disease allowing enjoyment of life with attainment of \nsatisfaction & contentment. Elaborate description is available on personal hygiene encompassing \ndiet and regimen during daily routine (Dinacharya), seasonal routine (Ritucharya) and \nbehavioral and ethical principles (Sadvritta). Observance of certain rules regarding suppressible \nand non-suppressible urges also paves way towards positive health. Cardiac risk factors can be \nprevented or managed by lifestyle including principles of Dinacharya, Ritucharya and sadvrtta.\n2. Concept of Ahara (Diet)\nAny material in the universe, according to Ayurveda is composed of five basic elements, \nthe Pancha Mahabhootas, namely Earth (Prithvi), Water (Ap), Fire (Teja), Air (Vayu) and \nEther (Akasha) including human body and the food. Tridoshas i.e. Vata, Pitta & Kapha which \nconstitutes the body is also made up of Panchamahabhootas viz Vata is made up of Vayu and\n1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI",

Regular physical exercise, not heavy \nexercise, keeps the body healthy, both by suppressing appetite after a while and burning extra \ncalories if needed.\n2.1 Viruddhahara (Dietetic Incompatibility)\nThe food with incompatible or contradictory qualities has poisonous effect on the body \nthat aggravates Tridoshas in turn leading to various disorders viz: Gulma (Lump), Allergies \nand Skin diseases. It also destroys strength, vigour, memory, immunity etc. The dietary \nincompatibility is due to Desha (climate), Kala (season), Agni (digestive power), Matra \n(quantity), Satmya (adaptability/customization), Doshas (tridosha), \nSamskara (mode of \nprocessing), Aharavirya (potency of food), Kostha (bowel habits) , Avastha (state of health), \nKrama (order of food intake), Parihara (restriction), Upachara (prescription), Sanyoga \n(combination) , Hridya (delicious), Sampad (richness of quality)and Vidhi (rules of eating).Few \ncontradictory combinations mentioned in the classics are fish or its soup along with milk, milk \nor milk products with alcoholic beverages , radish consumed with milk and lotus stem with \nhoney etc.\n3.

It not only \ncleanses the tongue but also stimulates digestion. Mouth should also be cleaned properly.\n• \nChewing of betel leaves with small pieces of Areca nut (Khadira) and fragrant substances \nlike cardamom, cloves, refreshes the mouth and enhance digestion.\n• \nIt is necessary to massage (Abhyanga) whole body with oil every day.

Whole year is divided into six seasons and detailed \ndietetic regimen for these seasons is prescribed. In spring season, bitter, hot and astringent diet \nis advised while salty, sour and sweet food should be avoided. Wheat, barley, honey syrup, \nfruits like mango, jack fruit-etc. and meat of forest animals is advised. In summer season due to \nhot climate, aggravation of pitta occurs. Hence pitta pacifying cold, liquid, sweet and oily diet \nis advised. Excessive hot, spicy, sour salty diet should be avoided. Intake of rice, milk, ghee, \nsugar, grapes, coconut water, meat of forest animals are advised. In rainy season aggravation of \nvata occurs, hence vata shamaka sweet, sour and salty food and drinks are preferred. The food \nshould be hot, dry, fatty and easily digestible.\n1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI",

Therefore, it is \nideal to take ghee processed with bitter drugs; purgation, bloodletting, coolant, and light diet are \nadvised. Diets dominant in Bitter, sweet, pungent diets are advised ideal in this season.\n3.3 Sadvritta (Rules of good conduct)\nAyurveda prescribes certain rules for maintaining healthy mind. These are principles \nof right conduct that are applicable to all people at all times and places. Practicing them gives \nbalance and harmony to the mind. These are\n• \nWhenever possible, devote your services to God, to the wise and to respectable or elderly \nindividuals.\n• Always speak the truth\n• \nDo not lose your temper under any circumstances\n• \nDo not get addicted to sensory pleasures.\n• \nDo not harm anyone.\n• \nAs far as possible, do not expose yourself to hardships.\n• Try to control your passions.\n• \nEndeavor to speak pleasant and sweet words.\n• Meditate every day for tranquility of mind.\n• Observe cleanliness in all things.\n• Be patient\n• Observe self-control\n• \nTry to distribute knowledge, good advice and help to others.\n• Be straightforward and kind.\n• Avoid irregularity in daily activities.\n• Avoid over eating, overdrinking, too much sexual activity, too much or too little sleep.\n• \nBehave according to the time and place where you are residing.\n• \nAct always in a courteous and polite manner.\n• Control your sense organs.\n• Make a habit of doing all that is good \nand avoiding all that is bad.\n3.4 Dharniya & Adharniyavega (Preventive Regimens)\nObservations of certain prescriptions and prohibitions given by Ayurved",

Preventive Cardiology-An overview\nMore than 50% of the deaths and disability from heart disease and strokes, which together \nkill more than 12 million people each year, can be cut down by a combination of simple and cost \neffective national efforts and individual attentions to reduce major risk factors. 80% of all CVD \ndeaths worldwide occur in developing, low and middle income countries. CVD has become one \nof the major leading causes of deaths in developing countries. It is estimated that 90% of CVD \nis preventable. Prevention of CVD involves improving risk factors through: healthy eating, \nexercise, avoidance of tobacco smoke and limiting alcohol intake.\n1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI\n\nAs per Ayurveda, the food consumed by an individual is transformed in the intestinal \ntract by the action of koshtagni i.e, digestive fire. Production of ahararasa, which is normal \nin quality and quantity, depends upon the normalcy of koshtagni. The Rasa Dhatu is the \nfirst Dhatu which gets formed from the Ahara Rasa i.e. nutrient portion of food after proper \ndigestion of food and is circulated by the action of vyana vayu throughout the body providing \nnutrition to seven dhatus, viz, Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Medas, Asthi, Majja and Sukra. The organs \nand channels through which this Rasa Samvahana (circulation) takes place are collectively \ntermed as Rasavaha Srotas and Hridaya along with the ten Mula Dhamanis (great vessels) are \nconsidered as Mula (main organ) of this Srotas.

In contrast, if the quality and quantity of Ahara \nand /or Kostagni are not in appropriate condition, it leads to improper digestion of food and \nsubsequent formation of abnormal Rasa dhatu which has direct impact on Hridaya, the seat of \nRasavaha srotas. In other words, the indiscretions followed by human beings in terms of Ahara \n(diet) and Vihara (lifestyle) can directly cause impairment of Agni and thus leads to formation \nof vitiated rasa dhatu. This vitiated rasadhatu is not capable of performing its normal functions \nof providing proper nutrition to seven dhatus in human body.\nAccording to Ayurveda, excessive consumption of food which is heavy to digest, dry, \ncold and with bitter or astringent qualities, excessive physical exertion, altered patterns of \nsleep including day sleep, forceful withholding of urges or initiation of urges, excessive \nindulgence in purgation, emesis or enema procedures, mental stress, excessive fear, over \nthinking, anxiety and indulgences in medications to counteract these things can be broadly \nclassified into Aharaja, Viharaja and Manasika factors which in turn vitiate the agni and \nsubsequently the rasadhatu. The impaired rasadhatu in circulation, in presence of impaired \nagni at the levels of koshta and dhatus and vitiated vyana vayu, eventually paves the way for \nmetabolic disorders such as medoroga, sthoulya, prameha etc which are milestones in the \npathogenesis of hrid-vikara.\nThe common causative/predisposing factors for hridrogas as described in authoritative \ntexts of Ayurveda are enumerated below so that these can be prevented for a healthy\nI INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I\nheart.\n1.

WHO defines mental health as a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his \nor her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able \nto contribute to her or his community. Mental health is the foundation for effective communication, learning, \nemotions, thinking and self-esteem in an individual.

Mental \nillness is often used as an umbrella term for all diagnosable mental disorders involving significant changes in \nthinking, emotion and/or behavior and functional problems in family society and work place. \nStudies estimate that at least 10% of the world’s population is affected by mental illness and that \n20% of children and adolescents suffer from some type of mental disorder. A study reveals that 56 million of \nIndian population suffers from depression and 38 million suffers from anxiety disorders. A report of WHO on \ndepression reveals that almost 7.5% of Indian population suffers from major or minor mental disorders that \nrequire medical intervention. National Health survey of India reveals that “Every sixth Indian needs mental \nhealth help\nIn contemporary science, the insights of the gut-brain axis have opened a new dimension to the way \nwe understand and treat mental illness which has led to creation of budding branches such as ‘Nutritional \nPsychiatry’. Healthy gut function has been linked to normal central nervous system (CNS) function. Hormones, \nneurotransmitters and immunological factors released from the gut are known to send signals to the brain either \ndirectly or via autonomic neurons. However, Ayurveda has documented the ‘body-mind’ relationship aeons ago \n. Attempts to study mind in a scientific perspective was evident from the beginning of Vedic period itself. \nYajurveda has tried to describe mind as a media for perception and memory. Unmada has been recorded \nfor the first time in Atharva veda with its various stages and treatment. During the Samhita period, various \nAyurveda treatises had compiled the aetiology, pathology, symptomatology and management of Unmada.\nAyurveda \ndefines \nUnmada \nas \na \ncondition \ncharacterised \nby \nimpairment/vitiation \nin \nfaculties \nsuch \nas \nManas(mind), \nBudhi \n(Intellect). \nSanjna(Consciousness), \nGnana(Perception), \nSmrti(Memory),Bhakti(Inclination),Sheela(Character),Chesta(Behaviour) and finally, Achara (Conduct) \nwhich impairs the person’s life itself.

Further Ayurveda has detailed the influence of mind on bodily factors \nsuch as Ojas, Rasa Dhatu, Panchavidha Vata, Pachaka Pitta, Sadhaka Pitta,etc. and also the critical impact of \ndiet and regimen on it. There exists a two-way relationship between mental disorders and unhealthy behaviours \nsuch as unwholesome diet and unwholesome regimen, which in turn acts as contributing factors to diseases \nsuch as Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Obesity and Diabetes, and a range of other life-threatening disease \nconditions. Improvement in a population’s mental health will lead to improvement in its physical health – and \nwill help enhance overall social and economic welfare. The role of Ahara-Vihara in the nation’s mental health \nis yet to be fully understood and brought to the purview of health sector. \nToday, contemporary psychiatry still lacks access to the caverns of mind and its functional attributes. \nAetio-pathogenesis of many psychiatric diseases is still not unravelled and the management is often only \npartially effective in bringing the person back to socially and medically acceptable normalcy. Hence, \n\nconstructive role should be given to strengthening of mind, maintaining a healthy balance of emotions and \npreventing onslaught of psychological disturbance. Role of nutrition in healthy mind is one of the most under-\nvalued concepts in psychiatry. Brain requires different amounts of   complex carbohydrates, essential fatty \nacids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and water to remain healthy. In order to reduce the prevalence of mental \ndisorders, an integrated approach which synchronously reflects the interplay of biological, psychological, \nspiritual and social aspects of Psychiatry is needed.  This book is intended as a preventive and curative \nguideline in psychiatric disorders for physicians and common man alike. \n1.2 Concept of  health in Ayurveda\nLife according to Ayurveda is a conglomeration of the four interdependent components \nnamely, the body (Shareera), the sensory and motor faculties (Indriya), the mind (Satva), and \nthe soul (Atma). A healthy life necessitates a perfect complementary support of all these factors \nand thus the concept of health encompasses physical, mental, sensory and spiritual domains. \nIt is also indicated that a person",

Synonyms \nof Mana are Chitta, Chetas, Hrit, Hridd, Manas and Satva.\n“Chittam chetah hrdayam svantam hrnmanasam manah iti” (Amarakosha 1/4/3)\nMana is the entity through which the knowledge is obtained, which is closely related with Atma, through \nwhich one can perceive and the seat of Mana is Hridaya.\nMana is the superior analyzing faculty, the seat of soul or Atma and controls the whole body, by accommodating \nthe superior senses and can be said as the seat of knowledge. The proof of existence of mind is given by \nAyurveda is the existence of knowledge (Lakshanam Manaso Jnana). According to Vedanta Darshana, Manas, \nBuddhi, Chitta and Ahankara combine are called four Antahkarana (Internal instruments/Mechanism). \nManas is told as ‘Ubhayatmaka’ i.e. it is a dual faculty which has both sensory and motor functions and hence \nconsidered as a superior faculty because it controls and co-ordinates all other faculties connecting them with \nthe soul.\nIn contemporary psychology, mind is an all-encompassing umbrella term that covers the joint functioning of \nthe brain and body in conjunction with the memory, world view, personality, soul, and other intangible facets \nof human life and psychology. It covers the way a person interacts with people and the world, how they learn \nand express themselves and how they relate to abstract concepts such as religion, spirituality, metaphysics, \nand other areas of thought. The mind is the manifestations of thought, perception, emotion, determination, \nmemory, knowledge, conscience and imagination that take place within the brain.\n1.4 Location/Seat of Manas \nIt \nis \nconventional \nin \nAyurveda \nto \nattribute \nanatomical \nsites \nfor \nconceptual \nentities \nto \nprovide some concrete feature to abstract ideas.  ‘सत्वादिधाम हृदयम् स्तनोरः कोष्ठमध्यगम्’ \nAcharya Vagbhata says that the Hrudaya (heart) is the seat of Satva or Manas, likewise Acharya Charaka and \nS",

Brain can be said as the physical \nstructure upon which the attributes of mind are bestowed upon. Hence the brain and mind has an intimate and \ncomplex relationship. With the advance in research in fields of neurology, psychiatry, psychopathology and \npsychology and remarkably advanced tools of molecular biology, various links has been established on the \nrole of brain and neurotransmitters in Psychiatric conditions. \n1.5 Gunas (Properties) of Manas\nThe properties of Manas are ‘Anutwa’ and ‘Ekatwa’ i.e., subtlety and singleness or oneness.  Due to its \nsingleness, only single knowledge occurs at a time. Manas remains engaged in a particular sense organ and \ncannot perceive two or more objects at a time.  And its subtlety enables it to move rapidly from one object to \n\nanother by which it may appear that simultaneous perception of several objects is taking place. The inability to \nfocus on one thing or inability to withdraw from perception related to any particular Vishaya or object may be \nconsidered abnormal. Prolonged lingering on one thought may form the basis of obsessions and compulsions \nwhile inability to focus may be seen as symptom in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD), \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder, Depressive Diorder etc\n1.6 Karma (Functions) of Manas\nThe functions/actions of Manas has been described as Indriabhigraha (control of sense organs), Svasyanigraha \n(self-restraint), Uhya (hypothesis) and Vichara (consideration).

Swasyanigraha is self-control, restraining self from \ntemptations and affected by emotions. \n1.7 Arthas (Objects) of Manas\nThe objects, which are perceived through the sensory organs, are termed as Artha. Considering Manas as an \nindependent Indriya, it must have its own objects, which are experienced by the mind. Thus, besides being \ncapable of perceiving Indriya Visaya (sensory objects), Manas has the ability of experiencing its own objects \nlike anything that is thinkable. Thus the objects of manas are:\n Chintya - object of thinking about do’s and don’ts\n Vicharya – object of Reasoning, logic and discrimination\n Uhya – object of Judgment or guessing\n Dhyeya –object of continuous thinking about desired things\n Sankalpa – object of imagination and evaluation as to merit and demerit\nManas also functions introspectively without the relation to the sense organs. Any knowledge gained through \nthis method or emotions perceived by the mind also become the subject of thought. Sukha(happiness), \nDukha(unhappiness), Kama(lust), Krodha(anger), Bhaya(fear), etc., belong to this kind of knowledge. \n1.8 Mind as a cognitive Processor\nManas process the inputs from outside perceived directly or indirectly through sense organs and develop \nresponses by the interrelated activity of its attributes \nOrganization\nPattern \nRecognition \nAttention\nMemory \nProblem solving \nLanguage \nReasoning \nDecision \nmaking\nFig: 1: Various aspects of mind \n\n1.9 Faculties related with Manas\nDhee, Dhruti, and Smruti are the three main faculties, which are closely related to Manas. \nDhee: [Buddhi]“Buddhirhi Nischayatmika” \nThe function of Buddhi is decision-making or determination of input Manas places before it, as perceived \nthrough Indriyas.

Those with superior mental strength [Pravara \nSatva] can withstand mental trauma well.  Those with inferior mental strength [Avara Satva] are incapable \nto suffer even trivial trauma and pain.

Psychological suffering is often \nexpressed through somatic problems. In individuals with difficulty in recognising and expressing emotions, \nphysical manifestations are often seen in the form of loss of sleep, decreased/increased appetite, loss of libido, \nvague aches and pains in the body, fatigue, anger issues, eating disorders etc. Some physical diseases such \nas eczema, psoriasis, auto immune diseases, blood pressure etc are thought to be prone to worsen by mental \nfactors such as anxiety and stress.

Those \nwith Doshic predominance are included under Nija and hence their Nidana, Laksaņa and Samprapti are \nexplained on the basis of Doshas and are further divided into Vatika, Paittika, Kapahaja & Sannipatika. The \nterm ‘Unmada’ refers to indiscriminant knowledge.

An unwholesome (excessive/deficient/distorted) stimulus perceived through senses, produces \nan unwholesome effect in the mind which in turn causes disturbance in the Sattvic quality of the mind and \ncreates a Rajasic or Tamasic state, which predisposes the individual to disease.

A wide list of factors under Prajnaparadha has been \ndescribed in Ayurveda2 \nA person whose intellect, fortitude and memory are impaired, subjects himself to intellectual blasphemy \nby virtue of his bad actions leading to the aggravation of all Doshas.  In Charaka Samhita the causes of \nManovikaras like Irshya, Shoka, Bhaya, Krodha, Mana, and Dvesha are attributed to the defects in the \nintellectual or mental faculty of the person.  \nDue to Prajnaparadha the person is unable to delineate the good and bad and therby causing impairment \nin judgement.  He dreams and desires unattainable things, become too much attached to worldly things and \nlaments over their loss and fails in facing adverse situations.  Hence Prajnaparadha is considered as the root \nfor all the manifestations.3 \nThough many other etiological factors are mentioned under etiological factors of Mano Rogas, Charaka has \nclearly said that due to the Prajnaparadha of the person only, he is affected with mental illness.4  \nIt is due to Prajnaparadha that the ignorant indulge in unwholesome gratification of senses, suppression of \nnatural urges, exposure to strain beyond their capacity and adoption of temporary pleasing regimen. But the \nwise due to the clarity of vision do not fall into it. Observance of certain regimens may produce temporary \nunhappiness but in the long run leads to happiness. The wise observe wholesome regimen after proper \nexamination and understanding whereas others who are devoid of these qualities are afflicted with Rajas and \nTamas, get tempted to do unwholesome activities and succumb to various types of psychosomatic diseases.5 \n2 Acharya Vidyadhar Shukla & Prof.Ravidutt Tripathi, Charaka Samhita, Vaidya Manorama Hindi Commentary,: Sharira1/102, \npage no.693, Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratisthan, Delhi",

A growing body of scientific \nevidence has demonstrated that lifestyle intervention is an essential component in the treatment of chronic \ndisease that can be as effective as medication but considered to be safe without risks and side effects. A \nlifestyle is a characteristic bundle of behaviours that makes sense to both others and oneself in a given time \nand place, including social relations, consumption, entertainment and such other behaviours.\n2.5  Dinacharya (Daily regimen)\nAyurveda promotes a lifestyle that’s in harmony with nature.\n• \t\nIt is advisable to wake up during Brahma Muhurta (preferably between 4.00 a.m. to 5.30 a.m.).\n• \t\nDrinking water early in the morning according to one’s capacity cleanses the body by enhancing the \nelimination of toxic wastes.\n• \t\nOne should attend the nature’s calls.\n• \t\nThe soft brushes made out of twigs of Khadira, Karanja, Apamarga etc. Tongue should be cleaned by a \nlong flexible strip of metal or plant twig.

Vegas can be said as the natural urges of the body which help the body in maintaining its internal \nhomeostasis by expelling the unwanted things. \nThe word ‘Vegadharan’ has two components Vega & Dharan. Vega means natural urge & Dharan is \nsuppression, thus Vegadharan means suppression of natural urges. Adharaniya vegas are the natural urges \nwhich should not be suppressed. Initiation of Vega is a normal body activity and is a process timely carried \nout by body at regular intervals & controlled by nervous system, suppression of which not only stops the \nelimination of waste products but also brings strain and disorders of nervous system causing many diseases. \nBy triggering an urge or suppressing an urge, Vata Dosha is being forcefully hampered and thereby leading to \nimbalance in the mind, which ultimately leads to psychosomatic diseases or purely somatic diseases. \n Dharaniya Vegas (suppressible urges) are Lobha (greed), Irshya (envy/jealousy), Dwesha (aversion), \nMaatsarya (competitive mentality), Raga (attachment).  Manasika vegas also include the other emotions like \nKama(lust), Krodha(anger), Bhaya (fear), Soka (grief), Chinta (anxiety). Excessive indulgence in Dharaneeya \nVega is the result of improper Atma-Indriya-Artha Samyoga and further impairs the synchrony of Manogunas. \nThus, one can understand that Manasika Vega is a result of vitiated Rajas and Tamas that cloud the mental",

Just as when curd is churned up, the butter which is the finest part gather up, the finest \npart of food rise up and nourishes Manas.\nSince Vedic era, food has been given the prime importance. Three categories of Ahara are described in \nBhagvad Geeta (17/8, 9, 10) are Sattvika, Rajasika & Tamasika.\nSattvika persons prefers food which increases life span, nourishes Satva, keeps body healthy, increases \nhappiness and prosperity, which are pleasing and full of nutrients, unctuous in nature, providing stability and \nconducive for the heart and soul3.

The physical exercises (Asanas) may \nincrease patient’s physical flexibility, coordination, and strength, while the breathing practices and meditation \nmay calm and focus the mind to develop greater awareness and diminish anxiety, and thus results in higher \nquality of life. Other beneficial effects include, a reduction of distress, blood pressure, and improvements \nin resilience, mood, and metabolic regulation. It has been found in many researches that yoga have positive \neffects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like \nschizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.\nSome studies even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and \npsychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting \nlevels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier \nbalance of lipids and growth factors — just as other forms of exercise do.\n\nSection-D\n    4.1 CONTEMPORARY REVIEW OF ROLE OF NUTRITION IN PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. \nThe 20th century has seen major shifts in dietary intakes globally, with a marked increase in the consumption \nof sugars, snack foods, take-away foods and high-energy foods. At the same time, the consumption of nutrient \nand fibre-dense foods is diminishing. The very large body of evidence that now exists suggests that diet \nis important to mental health in the same way as it is to physical health. Feeding the brain with a diet that \nprovides adequate amounts of complex carbohydrates, essential fats, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and \nwater can support healthy neurotransmitter activity. It can protect the brain from the effects of oxidants, which \nhave been shown negatively to impact mood and mental health.\nDry weight of the brain is composed of 60% fat and hence the fat we eat may be directly affect the structure \nand substance of the brain.

The \nmain reason being ignorance and obscureness prevailing around the concept of being afflicted with a mental \nillness, which is still considered a social stigma. Exploring its utility and developing its possibilities into a \ncomplementary support system to modern psychiatry is the need of the hour.  \nThe principles of Ayurvedic Psychiatry revolves around the concept of mutual inter relationship between the \n‘Psyche’ and ‘Soma’.  The psychic factors at large are influenced by the physical factors like food intake and \nactivities of daily life. The structural and functional components of the body viz, Dosha, Dhatu, Mala and \nOjas are nourished/maintained, depleted or vitiated by the influence of the Ahara and Vihara which becomes \nthe determinants of health and ill health. Reciprocally the status of ‘Satva’ is also indispensably affected by \nthese factors. The current statistics of psychiatric disorders also depicts the haphazardness of diet and regimen \nof modern life. In this regard Ayurvedic guidelines are of great relevance in the present era.     \nThese guidelines of Pathya Ahara and Vihara (conducive diet and regimen) work in different domains of \nintervention viz, Preventive, Curative, and Rehabilitative/ Supportive aspects. The ‘Satvavaisheshikakara \nBhavas’ or the decisive factors on the psyche of the future progeny holds prime importance in the pre-\nconceptional care. It reiterates the importance of prescribed diet and regimen in the couple for the best \npossible satva in the progeny. The sensory inputs, douhrida (longings during pregnancy), restricted activities \nand emotions etc are equally important in creating the psyche of the baby. The ‘Prasha’ or electuary in the \nnewborn and different sanskaras or ceremonies helps to prevent and check diseases.\nLong-term mental illness negatively affects the general health of the individual. The concepts of Sadvrita and \nAchara Rasayana help in the preventing derailment of mind.

But complete health is still a mirage for the \nmankind. Strong synthetic drugs are creating innumerable \nside effects known & unknown sometimes making the \ntreatment more dangerous than the disease itself. As a \ncontrast Ayurveda preaches gentle way of treatment mainly \nbased on herbs and diet. Many of most effected drugs are \nsimple, easily available and can be prepared at home.\nThis Booklet offers some simple recipes prepared from \nthe materials available in and around the kitchen, For simple \nproblems like cough, cold, indigestion etc, these preparations \nare very effective.

Vayu gives \nrise to seminal concretion called Shukraja \nAshmari. It obstructs the pathway of \nurine thus causing dysuria, scrotal \nswelling and lower abdominal pain. Its \nspecial characteristic feature is that it \ncan easily be dissolved by applying mild \npressure by hands over it. \nDifferential diagnosis of Renal \nCalculus:\n1.\t\nHorse shoe kidney: Congenital anomaly \nand usually asymptomatic.\n2.\t\nPolycystic kidney: Most common in \nfemale with symptoms like loin pain, \nhaematuria, hypertension, uremia.\n3.\t\nHydronephrosis: Dull ache in loin with \nbackache, due to obstructive uropathy. \n4.\t\nPyelonephritis (Acute/chronic): Asso­\nciated with headache, lassitude, febrile, \nnausea, vomiting and pain at renal \nangle.\n5.\t\nRenal Tuberculosis: Painless",

It is characterized by severe \nradiating pain starting from the low back \nto gluteal, posterior aspect of thigh, knee, \ncalf and dorsum of the foot of either one \nor both sides of lower limbs. The condition \nmakes raising of the leg difficult. All types of \nlumbar radicuolpathy also can be interpreted \nin terms of Gridhrasi. \nCase Definition:\nGridhrasi is defined as Stambha (stiffness), \nRuk (pain), Toda (pricking pain) in a radiating \nmanner along with Spandana (tingling sensa­\ntion) starting from Kati Pradesha (low back) \nto Prushtha (back), Janu (knee joints), Jangha \n(calf muscles) and Pada (dorso lateral aspect \nof feet) of either one side of the lower limb or \nmay involve both lower limbs. This condition \nmakes raising of the affected leg difficult. \nTypes:\nThere are two clinical presentations as Kevala \nVata and Kapha Vata.

When the clinical \npresentation is affected only one limb it is \ncalled Ekanga Vata. It may be associated with \nfacial palsy (Ardita) and speech difficulties \nlike aphasia (Vaksanga).

Ayurveda identify \nthe pathology of Pakshaghta in relation with \nCerebro Vascular Accident (CVA) and \nhence importance is given to Masthishkya \n(therapeutic applications on scalp). There \nare some limitations in Ayurveda for \nmanagement of acute stroke in comparison \nto approaches like thrombolysis etc in \nmodern medicine. Still in rural areas many \nAyurvedic practitioners are successfully \nattending acute stroke cases also. In addition \nto this, Ayurveda definitely has a major role \nto play in management of residual paralysis \nas well as rehabilitation of patient and to \nprevent disease induced muscle atrophy and \ncontractures. It also helps to improve muscle \nstrength in patients where loss of motor \npower is not complete. Many of the associated \nfeatures of hemiplegia like facial deviation, \nspeech and language deficits, bowel bladder \ndysfunctions etc can be successfully managed \nalong with improvement of motor functions. \nAyurvedic classics recommend long term \nmanagement in Pakshaghata like 3-4 months. \nThese include Snehana (internal & external), \nSwedana, Virechana, Basti, Nasya, Shirobasti \netc. which are possible in secondary or \ntertiary care hospitals only. The primary \nlevel care may be limited to prompt diagnosis \nand timely reference to higher centers at \nearly stages. They can also do follow up \n& rehabilitating care after discharge from \nsecondary or territory care hospitals.\nCase Definition \nPakshghata is defined as loss of motor functions \nor (and) sensations in any one side of the \nbody caused by vitiated Vata affecting Sira \nand Snayu located in the Moordha of contra \nlateral side. [Since facial palsy (other than \nBell’s palsy) is a common accompaniment \nof paralysis; cases with Ardita are also \nconsidered here for the purpose of better \nunderstanding while management.]\nDifferential Diagnosis\nIn Ayurveda the diagnosis of Pakshaghata \nin terms of Cerebro Vascular Accident is \nmade on the basis of various criteria like \nstages of the disease, extent of involvement",

On the \nbasis of symptoms it can be correlated with \nGlaucoma. \nGlaucoma is not a single disease process \nbut a group of disorders characterized by a \nprogressive optic neuropathy resulting in a \ncharacteristic appearance of the optic disc and \na specific pattern of irreversible visual field \ndefects that are associated frequently but not \ninvariably with raised intraocular pressure. \nThere are so many types of glaucoma out of \nwhich Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) \nand Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) \nare most common type. On the basis of signs \n& symptoms, POAG can be correlated with \nVataja & Kaphaja Adhimantha & PACG can be \ncorrelated with Raktaja & Pittaja Adhimantha.\nAyurvedic classification:\n1.\t\nVataja \nAdhimantha: \nUtpatyataiva- \nfeeling like eye ball extraction, Mathyate \nAranivat (feeling like eyeball is churned \nup by Arani – a churner for making \nbuttermilk out of curd), Sangharsa \n(Foreign body sensation), Todana & \n",

Simply it means running nose. In \nPratishyaya running nose, sneezing, heaviness \nin head, white thick nasal discharge, loss of \nappetite, itching of nose and eyes are the \nclinical presentation.1 According to Acharya \nSushruta the condition in which Kapha / Pitta \n/ Rakta Dosha moves in the direction of Vata \nDosha is referred to as Pratishyaya.2 Obviously \nthe definition iterates the significance of \nVata Dosha in the causation of the disease \nPratishyaya. In other words, it is mainly the \nVata Dosha whose equilibrium should be \nmaintained for the prevention/management \nof Pratishyaya. \nTypes of Pratishyaya:\n1.\t\nVataja: Nasal discharge is of watery and \ncopious type, sneezing and rhinorrhea.3\n2.\t\nPittaja: High grade inflammation is \npresent and leads to secondary infections \nlike furunculosis, discharge is thick and \npurulent.4\n3.\t\nKaphaja: Discharge becomes more thick, \npurulent and foul-smelling. Heaviness \nin head and the body is more in this \ntype.5\n4.\t\nRaktaja: Blood stained discharge. The \ninfection may spread to eye, causing red \neye.6\n5.\t\nSannipataja: The spontaneous disappear­\nance as well as appearance of Pratishy­\naya. Mixed symptoms of all the three \ntypes of Pratishyaya.7\nCase Definition:\nPatient presenting with continuous nasal \ndischarge,",

To advocate preventive and curative measures \neach person has been identified on the basis of psychosomatic constitution \nin addition to the status of health. The diseases are classified according to \npsychological, physiological or extrinsic causes and are categorized on the \nbasis of their prognosis such as curable, incurable. Therefore the thorough \nexamination of the person, diagnosis of the disease including its severity \nand stage, understanding of his surroundings are very important before \nplanning the health care measures.\nThe Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences \n(CCRAS) is an autonomous body of the Department of AYUSH \n(Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy), \nMinistry of Health & Family Welfare, and Government of India. This is an \napex body in India for the formulation, co-ordination, development and \npromotion of research on scientific lines in Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa \nsystems of medicine. The Council has been carrying out several research \nstudies through its peripheral institutes spread all over India for the last \nmore than three decades.

The findings of the research outcome are also \ndisseminated through various Research Journals, Technical Reports, \nMonographs etc. This booklet “Evidence Based Ayurvedic Practice” is an \neffort to compile all such possible publications and present them in the \nform of a prescription for a particular disease condition, covering eighteen \ndiseases.\nThe target users of this document are mainly qualified general \npractitioners of Ayurveda but it will be useful to the students, researchers, \nacademicians also. The prescriptions mentioned in this booklet are limited \nto CCRAS research outcome only. Other than these, numerous \nprescriptions are prevalent in different regions, which are based on the \ntextual references, experience of the physician and community practices. \nTherefore the service provider will have too many other treatment options \nand the physicians may plan the treatment as per there logical decision on\n\nthe basis of the need of the individual. Most of the medicines mentioned \nhere are available in the market and the composition is provided for new \ncombinations. While prescribing the medicines or procedures the general \nguidelines mentioned in the booklet may be followed by the qualified \nhealth care provider.\nOver all, this document provides a selective list of certain \nprescriptions based on available research publications of CCRAS work. \nI acknowledge the efforts put in by all the contributors in bringing out \nthis compendium and hope it will be useful to the users.\nThe Council places the record of appreciation for inputs and \nsuggestions offered by Dr. Bharti, Assistant Director (Ay.), Dr. Sobaran \nSingh, Research Officer (Ay.-Scientist 4), Dr. B.

Anaemia is an indicator of both poor \nnutrition and poor health. It occurs at all stages of the life, but is more \nprevalent in pregnant women and young children. Iron Deficiency Anaemia \n(IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. Iron \ndeficiency can arise either due to inadequate intake or poor bioavailability \nof dietary iron or due to excessive loss of iron from the body. The poor \nbioavailability of dietary iron is considered to be major reason for \nwidespread iron deficiency",

The poor \nbioavailability of dietary iron is considered to be major reason for \nwidespread iron deficiency. Some other factors leading to Anaemia are \nintestinal parasites (hookworm etc.) and Malaria.\nAccording to Ayruveda, Pandu is characterized by pallor of the \nbody which strikingly resembles with Anaemia of modem science. \nCorrecting Anaemia often requires an integrated approach due to \nmultifactorial nature of this disease, in order to effectively combat it. The \ncontributing factors must be identified and addressed. In settings where \niron deficiency is the most frequent cause, additional iron intake is usually \nprovided through iron supplements. There are many age-old remedies for \nthe treatment of this condition in Ayurveda.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nThe following intervention/ approach are based on CCRAS research from \npublished sources.\nIn case of iron deficiency anaemia:1\nDhatri Lauha - 500mg twice a day after meal with warm water \nfor 45 days.\nReferences\n1. \nMonograph on Clinical Safety and Efficacy of Dhatri Lauha (A classical Ayurvedic \npreparation) in Iron Deficiency Anaemia {Pandu roga), Published by CCRAS, Year: \n2010.\nANAEMIA (PANDU)\n\nANAEMIA (PANDU)\nMEDICINAL PLANTS USEFUL IN \nANAEMIA (PANDU)\nDaruharidra (Berberis aristata)\nVidanga (Embelia ribes)\nAmalaki (Emblica officinalis)\nDadima {Punica granatum)\nYashthimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra)\n\nBRONCHIAL ASTHAMA\nt  \n(TAMAKA SHWASA) \n4\nBackground\nBronchial Asthma (Tamaka Shwasa) is prevalent all over the world.

Type\nII Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by variable degree of insulin \nresistance, impaired insulin secretion and increased glucose production. \nThe classical symptoms of Diabetes Mellitus are polyuria (frequent \nurination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger).\nMadhumeha has been vividly described in classical Ayurvedic texts. \nA number of predisposing and etiological factors and complications of this \ndisease are described in great detail.

Among them Wuchereria bancrofti is most common in India (98%). \nAccording to the estimates made in 1995 globally, there are nearly 1100 \nmillion people at the risk of Filariasis and there are 120 million cases of \nFilariasis. According to another study in India, the population exposed to \nthe infection was 25 million in 1953 and 420 million in 1995. India is the \nlargest Filariasis endemic country in the world. Now India contributes \nabout 40% of the total global burden of Filariasis and accounts for about \n5 0% of the people at risk of infection.\nFilariasis was well known to ancient Indians by the name of \nShlipada. It is described that the word Shlipada must be understood as an \nincrease in the size of the foot. The word 'Shlipada' is derived from \n“shilavat padam shlipadam”, where the limb/foot becomes hard like \nstone.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nThe following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS \nresearch from published sources.\nFor patients of acute shlipada who have symptoms of swelling with \nfever:1\ni.

Sometimes, the track \nmay have a single opening which is called as sinus. Generally, this track \ndevelops from ano-rectal abscess {Bhagandara Pidika) that burst \nspontaneously or after inadequate incision. An anal fistula may occur with or \nwithout symptoms. There may be intermittent swelling with pain, \ndiscomfort and discharge of pus in the perineal region. This track does not \nheal usually due to fecal contamination, presence of unhealthy granulation \nand lack of rest to the part. This is a purely surgical condition but surgery has \nlot of complications and recurrence rate is also quite high after surgery.\nKsharasutra, a para surgical procedure and a unique technique \nadvocated by Ayurveda is described in Sushruta Samhita. Ksharasutra is a \nmedicated thread prepared by wetting the cotton thread with latex of Snuhi \n(Euphorbia nerifolia) and smearing it in the powder of Haridra (Curcuma \nlonga) and Apamarga (Achyranthes aspera) kshara followed by drying in \nspecially designed cabinet.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nKsharasutra procedure mentioned in the classical texts of Ayurveda was \nfurther developed after standardization and tried on large number of \npatients. The same approach is mentioned here for the treatment of fistula- \nin-ano. However, this procedure should be advocated by a qualified and \nexperienced physician/surgeon only.\nKsharasutra procedure112\nWith all aseptic precautions the Ksharasutra with the help of a probe \nshould be introduced from external opening of fistula to the orifice \ninside the rectal canal and the two ends of the thread should be tied. \nEvery week the old thread should be replaced by a new one by rod \nand reel method. The wound should be dressed with medicated \noil/ghee and T-bandage should be applied. \nPatient should be \nadvised to have sitz bath with warm water after each defecation.

According to modem terminology, Hemiplegia is usually \nthe sequel of cerebro-vascular disorders or stroke and most cerebro-vascular \ndiseases are manifested by the abrupt onset of a focal neurologic deficit. The \nclinical manifestations of stroke are highly variable because of the complex \nanatomy of the brain and its vasculature. Other features are weakness, \ndecreased movement control, clonus, spasticity, exaggerated deep tender \nreflexes and decreased endurance. Hemiplegia is the leading cause of \ndisability resulting into enormous socio economic implications.\nThe terms Paksaghata, Paksavadha and Ekanga-roga are synonyms \nof the same disease and are used in classical treatises in various contexts. \nCharaka included it in the classification of Nanatmaja Vyadhi due to \npredominance of Vata Dosha.

Usually, no symptoms develop unless hypertension is \nsevere or long-standing. Tests may be done to determine cause, assess \ndamage, and identify other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment involves \nlifestyle changes and drugs. Hypertension becomes common with age; the \nage-related increase in BP may seem innocuous, but higher BP increases \nmorbidity and mortality risk. Hypertension may develop during pregnancy \nalso.\nInAyurveda, the disease Vyanabala Vaishamya seems to be a result \nof the Vaishamya/ Vikriti of Vyanavata. Vata is responsible for the \nregulation of other dosha (Pitta and Kapha). In the pathological state also \nit has double path of vitiation viz. Dhatukshaya and by Avarana.

People having \n'android obesity' (abdominal fat distribution) are at increased risk from \nthose having 'gynoid obesity' (peripheral fat distribution around the body).\nAs per Ayurvedic concept, the excess accumulation of fat causes \npendulous movement of buttocks, belly etc. The obese person will suffer \nthe shortening of life span, difficulty in physical activity, difficult \ncopulation, general weakness, body odour, excess of sweating, excessive \nappetite and thirst.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nThe following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS \nresearch from published sources.\nFor obese patients with hypercholesterolaemia and excessive sweat:1\nArogya Vardhini Vati - 720mg in divided doses for 3 months.\nFor obese patients with weakness and dyslipidaemia:2\ni Combination of Vacha (",

It is impairment in motor or \nsensory function of the lower extremities. It is usually caused by spinal cord \ninjury or a congenital condition such as spina bifida that affects the neural \nelements of the spinal canal. The area of the spinal canal that is affected in \nparaplegia is either the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions. The extent to \nwhich the trunk is affected depends on the level of spinal cord injury. \nParaplegia is the result of damage to the cord at the level of T1 and below.\nParalysis or weakness of both lower limbs occurs in Pangu.

The pain of sciatic nerve originates \nfrom lower back and radiates towards buttocks, back of thighs, below the \nknee up to the foot. The pain is usually get worse on prolonged sitting, \nstanding and walking and relieved by lying down. The sciatica mostly \naffects the early and middle aged peoples, heavy weight lifters and persons \nwho are engaged in the occupations in which continuous pressure on back \nis used. The common causes of sciatica are herniated disc, spinal stenosis, \nspondylolisthesis, piriformis syndrome, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and \nsometimes during pregnancy. As the sciatica is considered as a \nmanifestation of underlying diseases, the line of treatment is to treat \nunderlying cause which irritate/ compress the sciatic nerve. Besides this, \nbed rest, physiotherapy, analgesics and muscle relaxants are being used. \nSometimes surgical intervention may be required.\nIn Ayurveda, Gridhrasi (Sciatica) is considered as one of the \nimportant Vata Vyadhi (neurological disorders). The disease is \ncharacterized by stiffness, pain and pricking sensation initially at the hip \nand gradually radiating towards waist, back, thigh, knee and calf region \nalong with frequent pulsation at these sites. Two types of Gridhrasi have \nbeen described viz. Vataja and Vatajakaphja. In both the main vitiated \ndosha is Vata.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nThe following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS \nresearch from published sources.\nIn case of tenderness of sciatic nerve and stiffness:1\nNirgundi Ghrita -1 Oml with 60ml Nirgundi (Vitex negundo)Kashaya \nonce in a day (at",
