Prologue
Ayurveda, the science of life, evolved from the quest of man to have a happy life, through a deep understanding 
of evolution, creation and its maintenance, perceived and conceived by the rishi’s of ancient India. The 
progressive establishment of scientific Ayurveda began in the Vedic period and has defined life as a manifestation 
of union of soul, mind and body those are integral and interdependent components of life. Ahara (wholesome 
food), nidra (Optimum sleep) and brahmacharya (selective Celibacy) has been given pivotal role in the 
maintenance of health. Along with diet, dinacharya and rtucharya has been given important role in the 
maintenance of disease. Ayurveda describes the wholesome and non-wholesome substances including diet, 
medicines etc. and has classified them into three major categories, viz, Shamana (palliative), Kopana 
(aggravating) and Swastha Hita (conducive to health).
Human body develops by assimilating nutrients from food. Wholesome food is the cause for excellence in 
health and unwholesome is responsible for disease. Ayurveda has developed the wisdom of dietetics on the 
basis of various natural perceptions at different levels of our sensorium. Ahara (wholesome food), Vihara 
(wholesome activities) and Aushadha (medicaments) form the cornerstone of palliative treatment.
Anatomy and physiology of skin has been dealt in detail by Ayurveda. The diseases of skin often mirror the 
in-equilibrium of dosha in the body as skin represents the substratum upon which the quality of ahararasa, 
which is obtained from Ahara, is depicted upon. The ICD-10 classification of human disease lists more than
1,000 skin or skin-related illnesses, a pattern dominated by a few conditions accounting for most of the skin 
disease burden. Despite this profound impact, skin disease continues to receive relatively little attention in the 
national or global health debate. Collectively, skin conditions were the 4th leading cause of nonfatal burden 
expressed as years lost due to disability in 2010.
Ayurveda has included skin diseases under the umbrella of Kushta and has pointed at its multifactorial 
etiology. Erroneous Diet and lifestyle have been implicated as chief factors for the onset, progression and 
recurrence of many skin diseases. They can prevent or alter the pathogenesis and affect the prognosis of 
skin diseases in a positive or negative manner.
The council has taken initiative to develop user friendly guidelines for prevention of common skin diseases 
through dietary and lifestyle advocacies based on authentic Ayurvedic commendations to meet the needs of 
this era. These guidelines are useful for health seekers and physicians alike.

Ayurveda based diet & life Style Guidelines/Intervention for Prevention and Management of Skin
Diseases
Background
Skin is the largest organ in the body and covers an area of approximately 1.4 to 2 M2. The skin protects the body 
from harmful agents such as ultraviolet light, chemical and infective organisms in the atmosphere. Skin also regulates 
body temperature, gathers sensory inputs from the environment, stores water, fat, and vitamin D, and plays a role in 
the immune system protecting from the disease. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and protects the 
body from the environment. The thickness of the epidermis varies in different types of skin; it is only .05 mm thick on 
the eyelids, and is 1.5 mm thick on the palms and the soles of the feet. The dermis is located beneath the epidermis 
and is the thickest of the three layers of the skin (1.5 to 4 mm thick), making up approximately 90 percent of the 
thickness of the skin. The main functions of the dermis are to regulate teFmperature and to supply the epidermis with 
nutrient-saturated blood. Much of the body’s water supply is stored within the dermis. This layer contains most of the 
skins’ specialized cells and structures, including lymphatic’s, blood vessels, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, collagen, 
elastin and nerve endings. The hypodermis (subcutaneous layer, or superficial fascia) lies between the dermis and 
underlying tissues and organs. It consists of mostly adipose tissue and is the storage site of most body fat.
Ayurveda explains twak as one among the 5 jnanendriya, attributed with the function of sensation of touch and is the 
location (ashray sthana) of sweat channels (swedavahi strotas) and hairs (loma). Susrutha and Bhavamishra'have 
opined that twak has 7 layers, while Vagbhatta and Charaka have described 6 layers of twak as tabulated below.

In Ayurveda, the treatment is aimed at prevention of diseases (swasthavritta) and cure of already manifested diseases 
through judicious and logical use of ahara (dietetics), vihara (lifestyle and oushadha (medication and therapies). The 
rational Ayurveda therapy is provided through 4 fold steps involving samshamana (palliation), dosha sodhana (bio- 
cleansing procedures), nidana parivarjana (avoiding causative factors) and pathya (dietetics suitable for disease 
pacification). Lifestyle or daily regimen ofan individual is equally important while ascertaining the individual vulnerability 
to disease. Elaborate description is available on personal hygiene encompassing diet and regimen during daily routine 
(Dinacharya), seasonal routine (Ritucharya) and behavioral and ethical principles (Sadvritta). Observance of certain 
rules regarding suppressible and non-suppressible urges also is important for positive health.
The concept of Ahara
Every living and non-living beings in this universe is composed of five basic elements, the Pancha Mahabhootas, 
namely Earth (Prithvi), Water (Ap), Fire (Teja), Air (Vayu) and Ether (Akasha) the panchabhuta components of 
ingested food nourishes their respective tissue elements in the body. Ahara is the best of all medicines and is considered 
one among the three sub-pillars of Ayurveda (thrayo-upasthamba). The ahara (food) and vihara (lifestyle) which are 
congenial to the channels, constitution and strength of an individual is termed as pathya (wholesome) and that which 
is non-congenial is termed as apathya (unwholesome). The preventive and curative aspects of Ayurveda revolve 
around the central theme of pathya ahara and vihara. Ayurveda emphasizes basic dietary guidelines in terms of 
appropriate food, combinations of food, methods of cooking, storage, eating atmosphere, hygiene and etiquette 
(ashtavidha ahara vidhi visesha ayatana) 2
Ayurvedic dietary guidelines3:
1. Intake of food at in time (Kale bhojana).
2. Food intake as per suitability (satmya bhojana)
3. Food intake as per the prakruthi of individual (hita bhojan)
4. Proper hygiene (suchi bhojan)
5. Intake of food which is unctuous (snigdha bhojan)
6. Intake of food which is warm (ushna bhojan)
7. Intake of food which is easy to digest (Laghu bhojan)
8. Eat while there is in interest to food and while eating concentrate on food and the process of eating (tan 
mana: bhojana)
9. Eat food with six taste components (sad-rasayukta ahara)
10. Food should be primarily sweet in nature (madhura praya)
11. Food should be ingested calmly, neither too slow nor too fast (na ati druta vilambita)
12. After bathing (snatah)
13. Food intake only when there is sufficient hunger (kshudvan)
14. Proper washing of hand, feet and face should be done before food intake (dhauta pada-kara-anana:)
15. After offering prayers and paying obeisance to gods and forefathers (pithru -deva tarpana)
16. After offering food to guests, teachers and chidren ( athithi- balakaguru tarpana)
17. Without disgracing food (anindan bhunjaana)
18. Silently (moun)

Ahara matra (quantity of food)
The food and nutritional requirement varies from person to person and depends upon the status of agni, sharira 
prakriti, age etc. Susruta and Vagbhata have suggested that if stomach capacity is hypothetically divided into 4 
parts on the basis of its filling , one should take 2 parts of solid food, 1 part of liquid food and 1 part should be 
left empty for easy movement of Vata4.
Sequence of food intake
Guru, madhura and snigdha food should be taken initially during the course of a meal followed by amla, lavana 
ahara. Food which is ruksha, katu, tikta and kashaya should be taken in the last part of the meal for proper 
activation of agni, proper absorption and assimilation of food. After taking food, it is advised to take rest for 
muhurta matra (48 minutes)5 for proper digestion.
Ahara vidhi viseshaayatana
To receive the total benefits of Ahara it is also necessary to have the knowledge about” Ashta ahara 
vidhivisheshaayatana”.they are
1. Prakriti-food should be taken considering the nature of food, such as guru (Heavy food like 
milk, flesh), laghu (food like green gram etc which are light to digest) , seeta (food which are 
cold in potency such as milk) , ushna (food which are of hot potency like spicy food), ruksha 
(dry ness inducing food), snigda( unctuous food such as ghee, butter) and their impact on agni .
2. Karana- It refers to modification in the food property by action of agni, water etc. dadhi is a 
substance which is prohibited to be used after heating.
3. Samyoga- it denotes the combinations of food which either augment or nullify the actions of the 
individual components.
4. Raashi-this represents the quantum of food required to each person
5. Desha-The dynamics and kinetics of the food consumed is dependent on the habitat of the 
individual and also the area from where the substance has originated.
6. Kaala- this represents time in terms of climate, phase of digestion, timing of the day, Stage 
(avastha) of disease etc.
7. Upayoga Samstha-food should be taken as per the rules of dietetics.
8. Upayokta-It denotes the consumer of the food. Food intake should be guided by the personal 
preference and okasatmya (habitual homologation) of each individual.

Virudha ahara6 (Dietetic Incompatibility)
In Ayurveda, the concept of virudhahara is very much pivotal in the pathogenesis of the disease. Acharya Charaka 
defines virudhahara as certain diet and its combinations, which interrupts the metabolism, which inhibits the process 
of formation of tissue and which have opposite property to that of the tissue are called as ViruddhaAnna or 
incompatible diet7. Virudha can be considered as diet which are having mutually contradictory properties, 
contradictory to tissues, diet capable of producing untoward effect on the body when processed in a particular 
form or proportion or those food which may produce an unwanted effect when taken at an inappropriate time. 
Ayurvedic literature has compiled almost 18 types of virudha ahara and has also mentioned complications ranging 
from skin diseases (kushta), visarpa (erysipelas), unmada (insanity) and marana (death).
Concept of Vihara (Lifestyle) in Ayurveda
The description about Dinacharya, Rtucharya, Sadvrtta and Nidra in Ayurveda clearly depicts the importance of 
a healthy regimen in the prevention and management of many diseases. A growing body of scientific evidence has 
demonstrated that lifestyle intervention is an essential component in the treatment of chronic disease that can be as 
effective as medication but considered to be safe without risks and side effects8. A lifestyle is a characteristic 
bundle of behaviours that makes sense to both others and oneself in a given time and place, including social 
relations consumption, entertainment and dress9.
Dinacharya (Daily regimen)
Ayurveda promotes a lifestyle that’s in harmony with nature
• 
It is advisable to wake up during Brahma Muhurta (preferably between 4.00 a.m. to 5.30 a.m.).
• 
Drinking water early in the morning according to one’s capacity cleanses the body by enhancing the 
elimination of toxic wastes.
• 
One should attend the nature’s calls.
• 
The soft brushes made out of twigs ofKhadira, Karanja, Apamarga etc. Tongue should be cleaned by 
a long flexible strip of metal or plant twig. It not only cleanses the tongue but also stimulates appetite and 
digestion. Mouth should also be cleaned properly.
• 
Eyes should be cleaned with fresh water to prevent eye diseases and promote vision. Also wash eyes with 
Triphala Phanta every day.
• 
Chewing ofbetel leaves with small pieces of Areca nut (kramuka) and fragrant substances like cardamom, 
cloves, refreshes the mouth and enhance digestion.
• 
It is necessary to massage whole body with oil every day. Oil massage ensures softness and unctuousness 
of skin, free movement ofjoints and muscles, peripheral circulation and elimination of metabolic wastes.
• 
Regular exercise is essential for perfect health. It builds up stamina and resistance against disease, clears 
the channels of body (Srotas) and increases the blood circulation. It enhances efficiency of body organs, 
promotes appetite and digestion and prevents obesity.
• 
Bathing improves enthusiasm, strength, sexual vigour, appetite, span of life and removes sweat and other 
impurities from the body. After bath one should wear clean clothes and smear the body with perfume. 
One should have regular shaving, haircut, cutting of nails etc.

• 
Person should avoid extra marital sexual relationship and sexual intercourse with a woman during her 
menses, pregnancy, within one and half month after delivery, devoid of passion, older than one and 
suffering from disease.
Ritucharya (Seasonal regimen)
In Ayurvedic classics, there has been a thorough consideration for seasons, besides the dietetic regimens for days 
and nights. Whole year is divided into six seasons and detailed dietetic regimen for these seasons is prescribed. In 
spring season, bitter, hot and astringent diet is advised while salty, sour and sweet food should be avoided. 
Wheat, barley, honey syrup, fruits like mango, jack fruit-etc. and meat of forest animals is advised. In summer 
season due to hot climate aggravation ofpitta occurs. Hence pitta pacifying cold, liquid, sweet and oily diet is 
advised. Excessive hot, spicy, sour salty diet should be avoided. Intake of rice, milk, ghee, sugar, grapes, coconut 
water, meat of forest animals are advised. In rainy season aggravation of vata occurs, hence vata shamaka 
sweet, sour and salty food and drinks are preferred. The food should be hot, dry, fatty and easily digestible. 
Preserved rice, wheat, barley and mutton soups are advised. In pre winter and winter season Vatadosha aggravates 
due to cold, dry, chily atmosphere hence vataghna, pittavardhaka diet is recommended. Hot, sweet, sour and 
salty food, milk, sugarcane, rice, oils and fats are advised and in autumn season aggravation of Pitta dosha 
occurs. Therefore, it is ideal to take ghee processed with bitter drugs; purgation, bloodletting, coolant, and light 
diet are advised. Diets dominant in Bitter, sweet, pungent diets are advised.
Sadvritta (Ethical Regimen): Rules of good conduct

applicable to all people at all times and places. Practicing them gives balance and harmony to the mind. These are
•

Non-Suppressible Urges
There are thirteen natural urges. Suppression of which leads to many diseases as given below:
• 
Suppression of urge for urination leads to difficulty in passing urine, urinary stone, atony of bladder and 
inflammation ofurinary tract.
• 
Suppression of urge for passing stool leads to pain in abdomen, indigestion, gas in abdomen, headache.
• 
Suppression of flatus leads to pain in abdomen, indigestion, heart diseases, constipation or diarrhea.
• 
Suppression of ejaculation of semen may produce a stone (Spermato-lith), pain in testis and difficulty in 
intercourse.
• 
Suppression ofvomiting produces different types ofdiseases like urticaria, giddiness, anaemia, hyperacidity, 
skin diseases and fever.
• 
Suppression of sneezing may produce rhinitis and chronic cold, headache, sinusitis and diseases of 
respiratory system.
• 
Suppression of eructation leads to hiccough, pain in chest, cough and loss of appetite.
• 
Suppression of yawning leads to diseases of the eyes, throat, ear and nose.
• 
Suppression of hunger and thirst may lead to nutritional disorders and debility.
• 
Suppression of tears leads to mental disorders, pain in chest, giddiness and digestive disorders.
• 
Suppression of exertion induced respiration may cause suffocation, respiratory disorders, heart diseases 
and even death.
•

Suppressible Urges
One should suppress urges of greed, grief, fear, fury, pride, shamelessness, envy and excessive passion. 
Observe self-control and always speak truth. One should not harm others and should always act in a courteous 
and polite manner.
• 
Dietetic and behavioural bad habits should be given up and good things should be taken up gradually. An 
intelligent person who seeks happiness should make a great effort to make good company and avoid the 
bad one.
Concept of skin diseases and its Etiology
Skin is given due importance since time immemorial owing to the aesthetic value conferred upon skin, complexion 
and beauty by the society. Ayurveda has given prime importance to ahara and vihara in the maintenance of health 
and prevention of diseases. In the recent past the relation between diet and skin ailments is well established in 
contemporary medicine. Ayurvedic literature has described skin diseases mainly under the spectrum of kushta, 
the literary meaning of which is that which cause disfiguration.
Ayurvedic system of medicine describes a wide range of etiological factors for dermatological disorders. The 
etiological factors include physical, physiological, psychological, psychosocial, hereditary and Papakarma (sinful 
activities), based on the proximity of causes which are reclassified into sannikrishta (proximal cause) and viprakrishta 
(remote cause) nidana
Sannikrista Nidana (real causative factor) - Three Doshas viz. Vata, Pitta and Kapha and four Dushyas viz. 
Tvak (Rasa), Rakta, Mansa and Ambu or Lasika involved in the pathogenesis of skin diseases. These seven can 
be considered as sannikrishta nidana in kushta.
Viprakrista Nidana -  These etiological factors are not involved directly in the pathogenesis, but they increase the 
disease proneness sensitize the body to the actual causative factors (Sannikrishta Nidana), Viprakusta nidana 
which include kulaja factors and janmottara kalaja (ahara, vihara and manasika factors).
Janmottarakalaja: The etiological factors in present life can be categorizes into three groups, Aharaja 
(diet & dietetic patterns), Viharaja (lifestyle related) and Manasika (psychological).
Kulaja Nidana: kushta is an adibalapravrtta roga which is said to arise from the day of conception by 
conjugation of sukra and artava with bijabhaga avayava dushti10. Ill effect is thought to be transmigrated 
from past lives (Poorva Janmakrata)
According to Sushruta if the person suffered from Kushtha in his previous life and if he takes rebirth then he 
develops Kushtha in his present life also Papakarma (sinful activities) has also been implicated in the etiology of 
kushta and is also said as a samsargja vyadhi (communicable disease). The Kushtha is generally described as 
Tridoshaja Vyadhi but type of the Kushtha ascertained upon the predominance of particular Dosha and is generally 
classified into mahakushta and ksudra kushta.

Nidana or the etiological factors closely linked with the manifestation, transmission and progression 
of the disease are broadly classified in the classical Ayurveda texts in the following categories:
1. Aharaja nidana- food related causes
2. Viharaja Nidana- regimen related causes
3. Manasika Nidana- psychological causes.
4. Visesha Nidana- an etiology that is not common in all diseases, but specifically act as hetu in this 
disease.
5. Sahaja Nidana -  those factors which causes disease due to beeja bhaga avayava dushti.
Thus the etiological factors of skin disorders may be related to food, life style and psychological 
factors.

The concept of samsargaia roga in Ayurveda (communicable diseases)
Samsargaja roga are those diseases which spread through contact in the form of frequent physical contact, 
through exhaled air, by dining, sleeping or sitting together and sharing objects that has been handled by the 
patient. Skin diseases, fever, TB & conjunctivitis etc are examples of such diseases.
• 
Frequent physical contact with the affected person (including sexual contact)

Through the exhaled air of patient (Airborne infection)
Dining, Sleeping and/or Sitting together
Sharing dress, ornaments and unguents (lotions, soaps,creams, oils and/or any 
other cosmetics)
Pathogenesis of Skin Diseases:-
Skin diseases often present and get triggered by multiple factors which are broadly classified as Aharaja, 
Viharaja, Manasika and Agantuka in nature which primarily initiate Agni Vaisamya and Raktadushti thus 
paves the way for deeper dhatu involvement. The three vitiated humours namely Vata, Pitta and Kapha in turn 
vitiate the skin, blood, muscle tissue and lymph. All these taken together, constitute the seven-fold pathogenic 
substances for the genesis of18 skin diseases i.e., seven major (Maha Kushta) and eleven minor (Khudra 
Kushta). All the seven factors are involved together in causing skin diseases, not in isolation of any one of these 
never cause this disease.

General management of Skin disorders:
In Ayurveda, skin disorders like any other diseases are treated with Samsodhana and Samsamana Chikitsa. 
As mentioned above, Samshodana Chikitsa plays a vital role in the management of skin disorders. Treatment 
of various skin disorders according to various Acharyas of Ayurveda are illustrated below.
• 
In Vatajakusta (skin disorders dominated by Vata), medicated ghee is first administered internally. In 
Pittaja kusta (skin disorders dominated by Pitta), Raktamokshana (blood-letting) and Virechana 
(Therapeutic Purgation) should be administered, Raktamokshana (blood-letting) should be performed 
in the less acute stage of kusta bypracchana (rubbing with a coarse device) and in more acute stage 
of kusta by venesection. Kaphaja kusta (skin disorders dominated by kapha) is treated with Vamana 
(Therapeutic Emesis).
• 
Snehapanam (Internal administration of medicated Sneha (unctuous substances)):
Prior to Samshodana, Snehana is done with internal administration of following Snehas
> Mahatiktaka ghrita
> Tiktaka ghrita
> Vajraka ghritam
> Maha Vajraka ghritam
> Tuvaraka taila or
> Bhallataka taila
• 
Swedana (Sudation) is done one day prior to Vamana (Therapeutic Emesis) or three days in case of 
Virechana (Therapeutic Purgation). Usually Mridu swedana is done like exposure to sun or taking 
hot water bath etc.
• 
Vamana (Therapeutic Emesis) is done with Kutaja (Holarrhena antidysenterica (ROTH.)
A.DC.),Madanaphala (Randia dumetorum LAM.) andMadhuka (Glycyrrhizaglabra L.) mixed 
with the juice or decoction ofPatola (Trichosanthes dioicaROXB.) and Nimba

Terminalia bellerica ROXB. & Phyllanthus emblicaL.)
> Manibhadra gudam or
> Avipatikara choornam.

• 
Depending upon the intensity of sodhana, Samsarjana krama (administration of regulated diet after 
the therapy) from 3 to 7days should be followed.
• 
In patients with excess of Vata dosa after Virechana (Therapeutic Purgation), asthapana vasti 
(Medicated Decoction Enema) and anuvasana vasti (Medicated oil enema) should be administered.
•

ARG.), Maricha (Piper nigrum L.), Phanijjhaka (Origanum majorana L.), Pippali (Piper 
longum L.) and fruit of Karanja (Pongamiapinnata (L.) PIERRE) cures kusta caused by 
aggravation of kapha and krimi.

Ahara and vihara forms the chief foundation up on which life ofindividual is founded. It is generally thought that 
diet has no direct relationship with diseases. But Ayurveda has described diet and regimen as the main causes 
for every disease. Contemporary medicine has less appreciated the role of dietary factors in the pathogenesis, 
progress and outcome of disease. Nutritional, biochemical and metabolic aspects of diet definitely play an 
important role in maintaining the normal integrity of skin and also promoting the immunological role of skin.
Traditionally, the verse depicts the importance of food
wmO 3\T’ “ which means that the outcome depends on the food that a person
consumes.
Dietary interventions may act as

• 
Preventive factor by restricting the pathogenesis of many diseases
• 
It may interfere the course of disease, thereby resolving early.
• 
Dietary and lifestyle modifications may act as an adjuvant to nullify the adverse effects of common 
medicines and also may work synergistically with medicines to cure the disease
• 
Adopting strict lifestyle and diet regimen may help in preventing not only skin diseases but also 
many life-styles induced serious systemic diseases
• 
Observance of specific diet or activity as triggering factors to skin diseases, by avoiding such can 
prevent exacerbations and relapses of the disease.
• 
These Pathya and Apathya may help in preventing modifiable co-morbidities.
