PREFACE
Ayurveda recommends individualized prescription of diet, lifestyle, 
medicines and therapies. To advocate preventive and curative measures 
each person has been identified on the basis of psychosomatic constitution 
in addition to the status of health. The diseases are classified according to 
psychological, physiological or extrinsic causes and are categorized on the 
basis of their prognosis such as curable, incurable. Therefore the thorough 
examination of the person, diagnosis of the disease including its severity 
and stage, understanding of his surroundings are very important before 
planning the health care measures.
The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences 
(CCRAS) is an autonomous body of the Department of AYUSH 
(Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy), 
Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, and Government of India. This is an 
apex body in India for the formulation, co-ordination, development and 
promotion of research on scientific lines in Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa 
systems of medicine. The Council has been carrying out several research 
studies through its peripheral institutes spread all over India for the last 
more than three decades. The findings of the research outcome are also 
disseminated through various Research Journals, Technical Reports, 
Monographs etc. This booklet “Evidence Based Ayurvedic Practice” is an 
effort to compile all such possible publications and present them in the 
form of a prescription for a particular disease condition, covering eighteen 
diseases.
The target users of this document are mainly qualified general 
practitioners of Ayurveda but it will be useful to the students, researchers, 
academicians also. The prescriptions mentioned in this booklet are limited 
to CCRAS research outcome only. Other than these, numerous 
prescriptions are prevalent in different regions, which are based on the 
textual references, experience of the physician and community practices. 
Therefore the service provider will have too many other treatment options 
and the physicians may plan the treatment as per there logical decision on

the basis of the need of the individual. Most of the medicines mentioned 
here are available in the market and the composition is provided for new 
combinations. While prescribing the medicines or procedures the general 
guidelines mentioned in the booklet may be followed by the qualified 
health care provider.
Over all, this document provides a selective list of certain 
prescriptions based on available research publications of CCRAS work. 
I acknowledge the efforts put in by all the contributors in bringing out 
this compendium and hope it will be useful to the users.
The Council places the record of appreciation for inputs and 
suggestions offered by Dr. Bharti, Assistant Director (Ay.), Dr. Sobaran 
Singh, Research Officer (Ay.-Scientist 4), Dr. B. S. Sharma, Research 
Officer (Ay.-Scientist 2) and Dr. Vinod Kumar Lavaniya, Research Officer 
(Ay.), CCRAS Hqrs. The assistance provided by Dr. Manjula and Dr. 
Savan, Senior Research Fellows is also acknowledged.
I am convinced that this endeavor assuredly pose markable impact 
in disseminating the merits of Ayurveda and research outcomes for their 
better utilization.

ANAEMIA (PANDU)
Background
Anaemia is a global public health setback affecting both developing and 
developed countries with major consequences for human health as well as 
social and economic development. Anaemia is an indicator of both poor 
nutrition and poor health. It occurs at all stages of the life, but is more 
prevalent in pregnant women and young children. Iron Deficiency Anaemia 
(IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. Iron 
deficiency can arise either due to inadequate intake or poor bioavailability 
of dietary iron or due to excessive loss of iron from the body. The poor 
bioavailability of dietary iron is considered to be major reason for 
widespread iron deficiency. Some other factors leading to Anaemia are 
intestinal parasites (hookworm etc.) and Malaria.
According to Ayruveda, Pandu is characterized by pallor of the 
body which strikingly resembles with Anaemia of modem science. 
Correcting Anaemia often requires an integrated approach due to 
multifactorial nature of this disease, in order to effectively combat it. The 
contributing factors must be identified and addressed. In settings where 
iron deficiency is the most frequent cause, additional iron intake is usually 
provided through iron supplements. There are many age-old remedies for 
the treatment of this condition in Ayurveda.
Intervention/ Approaches
The following intervention/ approach are based on CCRAS research from 
published sources.
In case of iron deficiency anaemia:1
Dhatri Lauha - 500mg twice a day after meal with warm water 
for 45 days.

BRONCHIAL ASTHAMA
t  
(TAMAKA SHWASA) 
4
Background
Bronchial Asthma (Tamaka Shwasa) is prevalent all over the world. It is 
characterized by chronic airway inflammation and increased airway 
responsiveness resulting in symptoms of wheeze, cough, chest tightness 
and dyspnoea. It is also functionally characterized by the airflow 
limitations usually reversed spontaneously or with treatment. The available 
treatment in modem medical science like bronchodilators, steroids even in 
the form of inhalers and leukatriene modifiers have made tremendous 
success in providing instant or symptomatic relief in Bronchial Asthma. 
But there is recurrent acute exacerbation & remissions and the treatment 
has many side effects like nausea, vomiting, tremor, huskiness of voice, 
disturbance of hypothalamus -  pituitary -adrenal axis.
In Ayurveda, the concept, etio-pathogenesis and treatment of 
Tamaka Shwasa have been described in detail. The clinical manifestations 
of Shwasa described in Ayurvedic classics have a striking similarity to the 
clinical manifestation of Bronchial Asthma. Many single and compound 
herbal and herbo-mineral preparations are mentioned in Ayurvedic 
classical text books.
Intervention/ Approaches
The following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS 
research from published sources.
In case of excessive cough and breathlessness:1
Kantakari Kwatha - 30ml thrice a day either alone or with honey.
In case of excessive cough with fever in the patients of Broncial 
Asthma:2
I Shirisha Twak Kwatha - 30ml thrice a day for 6 weeks.
ii Naradiya Laxmivilasa Rasa 500mg and Godanti Bhasma lgm - 
thrice a day for 6 weeks.
iii Shwasa Kesari Tablet (Kantakari with Godanti Bhasma) -1.5gm for 
6 weeks.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES (HRIDROGA)
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
(HRIDROGA) 
^
Background
Cardiovascular disease (Commonly called heart disease) is a class of 
diseases that involve the heart, blood vessels (arteries, capillaries, and veins) or 
both. Although cardiovascular disease usually affects older adults, the 
antecedents of cardiovascular disease, notably atherosclerosis, begin in 
early life, making primary prevention efforts necessary from childhood. 
There is therefore increased emphasis on preventing atherosclerosis by 
modifying risk factors, such as healthy eating, exercise, and avoidance of 
smoking tobacco. Heart disease is essentially a clinical syndrome of 
characteristic chest pain produced by increased work of the heart and is 
usually relieved by rest.
In Ayurveda it is known as Hridroga. It is of several types 
depending upon the characteristic features of the pain. If the pain is acute, 
and of shifting nature, this is usually known as Vatika Hridroga. If it is 
associated with burning sensation, then it is called Paittika Hridroga. In 
Kaphaja Hridroga, the pain is usually very mild and it is associated with 
heaviness, nausea and cough.
Intervention/ Approaches
The following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS 
research from published sources.
In case of angina (Vatika Hridroga)?
Pushkara Guggulu - 2gm thrice a day for 6 months.
For prevention of atherosclerosis and control of hyperlipidaemia:2
Guggulu (Commiphora wightii-crudz drug) 12-16gm/day in 
divided doses with lukewarm water for 3 months.

DIABETES (MADHUMEHA)
DIABETES (MADHUMEHA)
Background
Diabetes Mellitus (Madhumeha) is a group of metabolic diseases 
characterized by hyperglycemia which are caused due to reduced insulin 
secretion, decreased glucose utilization and increased glucose production. 
The secondary patho-physiological changes occur in multiple organ 
systems due to metabolic deregulation associated with Diabetes mellitus. 
The two categories of diabetes are type I or Insulin Dependent Diabetes 
Mellitus (IDDM) & type II or Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus 
(NIDDM). Complete or near total insulin deficiency is found in type I. Type
II Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by variable degree of insulin 
resistance, impaired insulin secretion and increased glucose production. 
The classical symptoms of Diabetes Mellitus are polyuria (frequent 
urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger).
Madhumeha has been vividly described in classical Ayurvedic texts. 
A number of predisposing and etiological factors and complications of this 
disease are described in great detail. According to Ayurveda, Madhumeha is 
a type of Prameha. All types of Prameha ultimately lead to Madhumeha. 
Sedentary life style, excessive sleep and over consumption of meat, fat rich 
food, milk & milk products, jaggery preparations etc. cause Prameha.
The prevalence of the disease increases with the age and affects men and 
women similarly but is slightly greater in men > 60 years. Types II Diabetes 
Mellitus is increasing more rapidly due to obesity caused by faulty food 
habits and sedentary life style.
Intervention/ Approaches
The following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS 
research from published sources
In early stage of Diabetes (pre diabetes to diabetes) associated with 
polyurea and fatigue:1
Ayush 82- 5gm with 500mg pure Shilajit thrice a day.
Ingredients of Ayush 82:
• Karavellaka (Momordica charantia) Seed 1 part

PEPTIC ULCER (PARINAMASHULA)
PEPTIC ULCER 
(PARINAMASHULA)
Background
Parinamashula mentioned in Ayurvedic literatures can be correlated to 
duodenal ulcer/peptic ulcer due to similarity in the symptoms i.e. the pain 
corresponding with the digestion of food. Peptic ulcers are a distinct breach 
in the mucosa of the stomach or first part of the small intestine, called 
duodenum or both. Helicobacter pylori are one of the most common causes 
of peptic ulcer. Ulcers can also be caused or worsened by drugs such as 
aspirin, ibuprofen, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Abdominal pain and tenderness in the epigastric area are the main 
presentations. Ayurveda offers a wide range of drugs for this condition.
Intervention/ Approaches
The following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS 
research from published sources.
For chronic patients of peptic ulcer who did not respond to Shamana 
treatment and when associated symptoms are of vata aggravation like 
abdominal pain:1
Indukanata Ghrita for Snehana- The treatment consists of

EPILEPSY (APASMARA)
EPILEPSY (APASMARA)
Background
Epilepsy (Apasmara) is defined as a condition in which a person has 
recurrent seizures. Seizures are episodes of disturbed brain functions that 
cause changes in attention or behavior. It is a chronic neurological 
condition caused by abnormal cerebral nerve cell activity. More than 2 
million people in the United States and over 50 million people worldwide 
suffer from epilepsy. The incidence of epilepsy is between 0.3 -  0.5 percent 
in different population throughout the world and the prevalence of epilepsy 
is roughly in the range of 5-10 persons per 1000.
According to Ayurveda, loss of smriti and loss of consciousness 
has been described to be the cardinal feature of the disease Apasmara. The 
nidana (causative factors) of Apasmara are sharirika (physical) like ahara 
(food) and vihara (lifestyle) and manasika (psychological). Signs and 
symptoms of Apasmara mentioned in Ayurveda are cardiac pain, visual 
hallucination, falling down, twitching of tongue and eyes, frothing 
salivation, tremors of hands and feet.

FILARIASIS (SHLIPADA)
FILARIASIS (SHLIPADA)
Background
Filariasis (Shlipada) is a vector borne parasitic disease caused by three 
nematode parasites viz., Wuchereria bancrofti, Burgia malayi and Burgia 
timori. Among them Wuchereria bancrofti is most common in India (98%). 
According to the estimates made in 1995 globally, there are nearly 1100 
million people at the risk of Filariasis and there are 120 million cases of 
Filariasis. According to another study in India, the population exposed to 
the infection was 25 million in 1953 and 420 million in 1995. India is the 
largest Filariasis endemic country in the world. Now India contributes 
about 40% of the total global burden of Filariasis and accounts for about 
5 0% of the people at risk of infection.
Filariasis was well known to ancient Indians by the name of 
Shlipada. It is described that the word Shlipada must be understood as an 
increase in the size of the foot. The word 'Shlipada' is derived from 
“shilavat padam shlipadam”, where the limb/foot becomes hard like 
stone.

FISTULA-IN-ANO
(BHAGANDARA)
A
Background
Fistula-in-ano {Bhagandara) is a track which opens deeply in the anal canal 
or rectum and superficially on the skin around the anus. Sometimes, the track 
may have a single opening which is called as sinus. Generally, this track 
develops from ano-rectal abscess {Bhagandara Pidika) that burst 
spontaneously or after inadequate incision. An anal fistula may occur with or 
without symptoms. There may be intermittent swelling with pain, 
discomfort and discharge of pus in the perineal region. This track does not 
heal usually due to fecal contamination, presence of unhealthy granulation 
and lack of rest to the part. This is a purely surgical condition but surgery has 
lot of complications and recurrence rate is also quite high after surgery.
Ksharasutra, a para surgical procedure and a unique technique 
advocated by Ayurveda is described in Sushruta Samhita. Ksharasutra is a 
medicated thread prepared by wetting the cotton thread with latex of Snuhi 
(Euphorbia nerifolia) and smearing it in the powder of Haridra (Curcuma 
longa) and Apamarga (Achyranthes aspera) kshara followed by drying in 
specially designed cabinet.
Intervention/ Approaches
Ksharasutra procedure mentioned in the classical texts of Ayurveda was 
further developed after standardization and tried on large number of 
patients. The same approach is mentioned here for the treatment of fistula- 
in-ano. However, this procedure should be advocated by a qualified and 
experienced physician/surgeon only.
Ksharasutra procedure112
With all aseptic precautions the Ksharasutra with the help of a probe 
should be introduced from external opening of fistula to the orifice 
inside the rectal canal and the two ends of the thread should be tied. 
Every week the old thread should be replaced by a new one by rod 
and reel method. The wound should be dressed with medicated 
oil/ghee and T-bandage should be applied. 
Patient should be 
advised to have sitz bath with warm water after each defecation. This 
should be repeated till the fistulous tract is fully open. Later, the 
wound management should be done till the complete healing.

HAEMORRHOIDS (ARSHA)
Background
Haemorrhoids or Piles (Arsha) are common anorectal diseases which arises 
from the congestion of the internal and/or external venous plexuses around 
the anal canal. Haemorrhoids are of two types, external and internal. The 
external Haemorrhoids occur outside the anal verge and are often painful 
when accompanied by swelling and irritation. The internal Haemorrhoids 
occur inside the rectum and are usually not painful but may bleed when 
irritated. Sushruta has described fourfold method for the treatment of Arsha, 
which are Bheshaja, Kshara, Agni and Shastra. Bheshaja i.e. medical or 
conservative treatment includes various Ayurvedic medicines which are 
mild laxative, styptic, anti-inflammatory in action. The topical application 
or enema of oil and ghee preparations is also recommended

HEMIPLEGIA (PAKSHAGHATA)
Background
Pakshaghata (Hemiplegia) is one of the major neurological disorders 
manifested as inability to move the group of muscles of either left or right 
side of the body. According to modem terminology, Hemiplegia is usually 
the sequel of cerebro-vascular disorders or stroke and most cerebro-vascular 
diseases are manifested by the abrupt onset of a focal neurologic deficit. The 
clinical manifestations of stroke are highly variable because of the complex 
anatomy of the brain and its vasculature. Other features are weakness, 
decreased movement control, clonus, spasticity, exaggerated deep tender 
reflexes and decreased endurance. Hemiplegia is the leading cause of 
disability resulting into enormous socio economic implications.
The terms Paksaghata, Paksavadha and Ekanga-roga are synonyms 
of the same disease and are used in classical treatises in various contexts. 
Charaka included it in the classification of Nanatmaja Vyadhi due to 
predominance of Vata Dosha. The disease affects the Madhyama Roga 
Marga (Marma and Asthi Sandhi) and disrupts the functions of Sira (blood 
vessels), Snayu (ligaments) Kandara (tendon) etc. The modem life style, 
dietary habits, lack of proper exercise, injudicious way of physical activities 
and mental stress and strain are said to have definite role in the occurrence of 
Paksaghata.

a
Background
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting blood pressure; systolic, 
diastolic or both. Usually, no symptoms develop unless hypertension is 
severe or long-standing. Tests may be done to determine cause, assess 
damage, and identify other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment involves 
lifestyle changes and drugs. Hypertension becomes common with age; the 
age-related increase in BP may seem innocuous, but higher BP increases 
morbidity and mortality risk. Hypertension may develop during pregnancy 
also.
InAyurveda, the disease Vyanabala Vaishamya seems to be a result 
of the Vaishamya/ Vikriti of Vyanavata. Vata is responsible for the 
regulation of other dosha (Pitta and Kapha). In the pathological state also 
it has double path of vitiation viz. Dhatukshaya and by Avarana. Though a 
direct disease condition comparable to hypertension is not mentioned in the 
classics, its symptomatology is found in the chapters of Vata Vyadhi, 
Prameha, Hridroga etc.

MALARIA (VISHAMA JVARA)
Background
Malaria (Vishama Jvara) is one of the most prevalent vector borne disease. 
Malaria is a protozoal disease caused by infection with parasites of the 
genus plasmodium and transmitted to man by certain species of infected 
female Anophelese mosquito. The incidence of malaria worldwide is 
estimated to be 300-500 million clinical cases each year and Malaria is 
estimated to kill between 1.1 and 2.7 million people worldwide each year. It 
is mostly caused by Plasmodium falciparaum. In India, during 2003 about 
1.65 million cases were reported with 943 deaths and there were 0.7 million 
cases of P. falciparum malaria.
In Ayurvedic literature Malaria fever is known as Vishama Jvara 
(intermittent fever) and many drugs are prescribed for its treatment.
Intervention/ Approaches
The following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS 
research from published sources. However, in malaria the first and 
immediate choice of treatment should be antibiotics and the medicines 
mentioned in this document may be added on or used when the antibiotics 
are not effective.

OBESITY AND LIPID DISORDERS
^  
(MEDOROGA)

Background
Obesity (Medoroga) is a condition in which there is excessive 
accumulation of fat in the body. It is defined as a state of excess adipose 
tissue mass and is generally assessed on the basis of body mass index. 
Obesity is more common among women. Globally the disease is prevalent 
in about more than 300 million adults worldwide (WHO World Health 
Report, 2003).In India, obesity is increasing at an alarming rate with 
morbid obesity affecting about 5% of the Indian population. People having 
'android obesity' (abdominal fat distribution) are at increased risk from 
those having 'gynoid obesity' (peripheral fat distribution around the body).
As per Ayurvedic concept, the excess accumulation of fat causes 
pendulous movement of buttocks, belly etc. The obese person will suffer 
the shortening of life span, difficulty in physical activity, difficult 
copulation, general weakness, body odour, excess of sweating, excessive 
appetite and thirst.
Intervention/ Approaches
The following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS 
research from published sources.
For obese patients with hypercholesterolaemia and excessive sweat:1
Arogya Vardhini Vati - 720mg in divided doses for 3 months.
For obese patients with weakness and dyslipidaemia:2
i Combination of Vacha (Acorus calamus) and Katuki (Picrorhiza 
kurroa) in equal ratio - lgm thrice a day with luke warm 
water.
ii Triphala Shodhita Guggulu -1 gm thrice a day.

PARAPLEGIA (PANGU)
PARAPLEGIA (PANGU)
Background
Paraplegia describes complete or incomplete paralysis affecting the legs and 
possibly also the trunk, but not the arms. It is impairment in motor or 
sensory function of the lower extremities. It is usually caused by spinal cord 
injury or a congenital condition such as spina bifida that affects the neural 
elements of the spinal canal. The area of the spinal canal that is affected in 
paraplegia is either the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions. The extent to 
which the trunk is affected depends on the level of spinal cord injury. 
Paraplegia is the result of damage to the cord at the level of T1 and below.
Paralysis or weakness of both lower limbs occurs in Pangu. It is 
Vata predominant disease and limping movement (Vikalagati) is the literal 
meaning of Pangu, where both the lower limbs are involved. Specific 
Nidana of Pangu has not been mentioned, because it is mentioned as one of 
the disorder of vitiated Vayu. Hence the factors, which are responsible for 
the vitiation of Vayu can be considered as the Nidana of Pangu also.

PSORIASIS (KITIBHA)
Background
Psoriasis is a common chronic non-infectious inflammatory skin disease. 
It is characterized by erythematous sharply demarcated papules and 
rounded plaques covered by silvery micaceous scale. In Psoriasis, main 
abnormality is of increased epidermal proliferation due to excessive 
multiplication of cells in the basal layers. There are five types of Psoriasis 
-Plaque, Guttate, Inverse, Pustular and Erythrodermic. The most 
common type is Plaque Psoriasis in which red and white hues of scaly 
patches appears on the topmost layer of the epidermis which gives it a 
silvery white appearance. Psoriasis causes skin redness and irritation.
As per Ayurvedic concept, Kitibha is classified under Kshudra 
Kushtha. In Ayurveda the causative factors of skin disease are elaborately 
classified. Continued practice of Apathya Ahara and Vihara vitiates the 
dosha & dhatu and causes Kitibha.

research from published sources.

Background
Rheumatoid Arthritis (Amavata) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease 
that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, destruction and functional disability in 
the affected joints. It is defined as a chronic multisystem disease 
characterized by persistent inflammatory synovitis, usually involving 
peripheral joints in a symmetric distribution with a potential to cause 
cartilage destruction and bone erosions. Rheumatoid Arthritis affects all 
races throughout the world and it is 3 times more common in women than 
men. Generally, it occurs during the fourth and fifth decades of life but 
people of any age can be affected.
According to Ayurveda, the main cause of the disease is formation of 
Ama due to Agnimandya. The general principles of treatment of this disease 
in Ayurveda lay emphasis on stimulating and normalizing the impaired 
Agni by the use of Langhana, Deepana, Pachana, and Katu, Tikta Rasa 
predominant drugs (for the correction of digestion and metabolism). For

SCIATICA (GRIDHRASI)
SCIATICA (GRIDHRASI)
Background
Sciatica refers to pain, numbness and tingling of lower limb resulting from 
injury or compression of sciatic nerve. The pain of sciatic nerve originates 
from lower back and radiates towards buttocks, back of thighs, below the 
knee up to the foot. The pain is usually get worse on prolonged sitting, 
standing and walking and relieved by lying down. The sciatica mostly 
affects the early and middle aged peoples, heavy weight lifters and persons 
who are engaged in the occupations in which continuous pressure on back 
is used. The common causes of sciatica are herniated disc, spinal stenosis, 
spondylolisthesis, piriformis syndrome, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and 
sometimes during pregnancy. As the sciatica is considered as a 
manifestation of underlying diseases, the line of treatment is to treat 
underlying cause which irritate/ compress the sciatic nerve. Besides this, 
bed rest, physiotherapy, analgesics and muscle relaxants are being used. 
Sometimes surgical intervention may be required.
In Ayurveda, Gridhrasi (Sciatica) is considered as one of the 
important Vata Vyadhi (neurological disorders). The disease is 
characterized by stiffness, pain and pricking sensation initially at the hip 
and gradually radiating towards waist, back, thigh, knee and calf region

Background
Urolithiasis (Mutrashmari) is the condition where stones are formed or 
located anywhere in the urinary system. Urinary stones are typically 
classified by their location or by their chemical composition (calcium 
containing, struvite, uric acid, or other compounds). Main symptom is the 
pain most commonly felt in the flank, lower abdomen and groin. Renal colic 
can be associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, blood or pus in the urine and 
painful urination. In Ayurveda a number of drugs are mentioned to treat 
Mutrashmari.
