FOREWORD
Most of the diseases arise due to improper food habits 
and faulty life style besides hereditary and other reasons. 
Mankind has constantly grappled with ill health and tried to 
achieve health & happiness. These efforts are on from time 
immemorial. These endeavors have thrown up various 
systems of medicine. Ayurveda is one such system evolved 
in India, which tries to bring harmony between man & nature 
by using holistic methods of diagnosis, prevention and 
treatment. Like all other Indian contributions it is intertwined 
with Indian philosophy, yoga and science.
The modem since is successful in inventing medicines for 
many diseases. But complete health is still a mirage for the 
mankind. Strong synthetic drugs are creating innumerable 
side effects known & unknown sometimes making the 
treatment more dangerous than the disease itself. As a 
contrast Ayurveda preaches gentle way of treatment mainly 
based on herbs and diet. Many of most effected drugs are 
simple, easily available and can be prepared at home.
This Booklet offers some simple recipes prepared from 
the materials available in and around the kitchen, For simple 
problems like cough, cold, indigestion etc, these preparations 
are very effective. For chronic problems like diabetes, joint 
pain, skin diseases these remedies may be used even along 
with other medication.
I hope that this booklet will be beneficial to the readers.
