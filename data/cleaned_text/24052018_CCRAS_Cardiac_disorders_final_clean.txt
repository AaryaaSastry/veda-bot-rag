Prologue
Ayurveda evolved as a comprehensive health care system through systematic experimentation by 
generating reproducible evidence. These evidences are further expanded and documented as 
classical texts of Ayurveda such as Charaka Samhita, Susrutha Samhita, Astanga Sangraha etc. 
Further in the medieval period, several new classics such as Bhavaprakasha, Shamgdhara 
Samhita, Chakradatta etc have expanded the scope, emphasizing on prevention and management 
of diseases through dietary and preventive interventions.
Ayurveda vividly describes the conducive and non-conducive substances including diet, 
medicines etc and has classified them into three major categories, viz, Shamana (palliative), 
Kopana (aggravating) and Swastha Hita (conducive to health). Ayurveda has also emphasized on 
three major factors responsible for causation of any illness such as Asatmyendriyartha Samyoga 
(incompatible correlation of sense organs), Prajnaparadha (intellectual blasphemy) and 
Parinama (disharmony with rhythms and cycles of nature); avoidance of which is essential for 
maintenance of health and prevention of diseases.
Detailed description concerning functional anatomy and physiology of Hridaya and associated 
illnesses are available in Ayurvedic literature. Hridaya (heart) is the mula (main seat) of 
Rasavaha Srotas or circulatory system in the body. The vitiation of this system may lead to 
diseases such as Sthoulya, Hridroga etc. The role of Vyana Vayu and Ojus which are major 
functional attributes also contribute significantly to the health and disease of cardio-vascular 
system.
In recent times, there has been an emerging shift in epidemiologic and demographic pattern of 
diseases, and non-communicable diseases are emerging as a major share of disease burden in 
developing countries. Cardiovascular disorders and other allied conditions contributing to 
cardiac illness are also spreading in this pattern. Prevention and management of these conditions 
are pivotal to reduce the disease burden and also facilitate to cut the health costs grossly. 
Ayurveda offers a comprehensive and personalized approach for such conditions.
The council has taken initiatives to present a user friendly guidelines on prevention of cardio­
vascular diseases through dietary and lifestyle advocacies based on principles of Ayurveda, 
meeting the contemporary requirements. These guidelines are certainly useful for physicians and 
health seekers alike, approaching Ayurveda healthcare set-ups.

AYURVEDA BASED DIET & LIFE STYLE GUIDELINES 
FOR PREVENTION OF CARDIAC DISORDERS 
1. Background
The incidence of lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, 
and overweight/obesity associated with cardiovascular diseases is on the rise. Cardiovascular 
disorders continue to be the major cause of mortality representing about 30% of all deaths 
worldwide. With rapid economic development and increasing urbanization of lifestyle in the past 
few decades, prevalence of these diseases has reached alarming proportions among Indians in the 
recent years. As Ayurveda is recognized as foremost life science and describes ways to prevent 
and manage lifestyle disorders, the world is being attracted towards its potential. Ayurveda 
provides effective solutions in the forms of dietary regulation, lifestyle advisory, detoxification 
and bio-purification procedures like Panchakarma, since it targets preventive, palliative 
rejuvenative interventions and medicaments. The holistic approach of Ayurveda, treating the 
patient as a whole, meaning intervention targeted towards complete physical, psychological, 
and spiritual well-being makes this science a wonderful option in lifestyle disorders.
Basically in Ayurveda, promotion of health and prevention of diseases is given more 
importance than the treatment of the diseases. Health and diseases is dependent on three factors
1.e. Ahara (Diet), Vihara (life style practices) & Oushadha (Drug& therapies). Among these, 
food (Ahara) is considered as most important one. Pathya is defined as the ahara (diet) which 
is congenial to a person according to his constitution, appetite & digestive capacity of the body. 
Most health problems develop due to the wrong eating and improper cooking. The planning 
of diet, based on certain principles mentioned in Astavidhi vishesayatan is very rational and 
scientific. Ayurveda emphasizes the characteristics of food in terms of quality, quantity and time 
which vary with age, constitution, habitat, digestive power, season, disease and also liking of 
the patient. One has to consume the diet, which is suitable to him in all aspects, and deviation 
from these may cause diseases. In addition to these, wrong cooking procedures, irregular timing, 
and consuming imbalanced and non-congenial food and not following the prescribed rules for 
preparing, preserving and eating food may also cause imbalance of health. The proper intake 
of diet not only can prevent many health disorders but also plays major role in the management 
of diseases. Therefore, due consideration should be given to all aspects of diet- planning for 
treatment of diseases and to maintain the health, according to Ayurveda.
The Ayurvedic regime of healthy life is designed for achievement of a long, healthy 
active life, providing relief from pain and disease allowing enjoyment of life with attainment of 
satisfaction & contentment. Elaborate description is available on personal hygiene encompassing 
diet and regimen during daily routine (Dinacharya), seasonal routine (Ritucharya) and 
behavioral and ethical principles (Sadvritta). Observance of certain rules regarding suppressible 
and non-suppressible urges also paves way towards positive health. Cardiac risk factors can be 
prevented or managed by lifestyle including principles of Dinacharya, Ritucharya and sadvrtta.
2. Concept of Ahara (Diet)
Any material in the universe, according to Ayurveda is composed of five basic elements, 
the Pancha Mahabhootas, namely Earth (Prithvi), Water (Ap), Fire (Teja), Air (Vayu) and 
Ether (Akasha) including human body and the food. Tridoshas i.e. Vata, Pitta & Kapha which 
constitutes the body is also made up of Panchamahabhootas viz Vata is made up of Vayu and
1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI

Akasha mahabhoota, Pitta is made up of Agni and Jala mahabhoota and Kapha is made up 
of Jala and Prthvi mahabhoota. Planning and indulging in the diet balancing these elements 
maintain the homoeostasis of the body.
Each dietary item may have dosha aggravating, dosha pacifying or dosha balancing 
actions in the body. Specific diet has been mentioned in Ayurveda to maintain the balance of 
Doshas disturbed due to various factors like season, age etc.The food contains six basic tastes 
and each taste has pre-dominance of particular elements of Pancha mahabhoota which exerts 
specific effect on the Tridoshas & Dhatus.The Madhura (Sweet) rasa has predominance of 
Prithvi & Aap elements, Amla (Sour) rasa has predominance of Prithvi & Agni, Lavana (Salt) 
rasa has predominance of Aap & Agni, Katu (Pungent) rasa has predominance of Agni & Vayu, 
Thikta (Bitter) rasa has predominance of Vayu & Akash and Kashaya (Astringent) rasa has 
predominance of Prithvi & Vayu. It is mentioned that, drugs having sweet, sour and salty taste 
alleviate Vata, those having astringent, sweet and bitter tastes alleviate Pitta and those having 
astringent, pungent and bitter tastes alleviate Kapha dosha.
In Ayurveda specific principles are described for consuming diet. It is not possible to 
derive the entire benefit out of food, simply on the basis of quantity of intake, without considering 
the eight factors like Prakrti (Qualitative characteristics of the food), Karana (Processing of 
food), Samyoga (combination of food), Rashi (The quantity of food), Desha (Habitat of the 
person), Kala (Time& seasonal variation), Upayoga Samstha (Variable digestibility of various 
food articles) and Upayokta (The person who consumes the food).
Fat rich diet harms the body in the long run and very low fat diet is also unhealthy in 
that it could result in fatty acid deficiency syndromes. Regular physical exercise, not heavy 
exercise, keeps the body healthy, both by suppressing appetite after a while and burning extra 
calories if needed.
2.1 Viruddhahara (Dietetic Incompatibility)
The food with incompatible or contradictory qualities has poisonous effect on the body 
that aggravates Tridoshas in turn leading to various disorders viz: Gulma (Lump), Allergies 
and Skin diseases. It also destroys strength, vigour, memory, immunity etc. The dietary 
incompatibility is due to Desha (climate), Kala (season), Agni (digestive power), Matra 
(quantity), Satmya (adaptability/customization), Doshas (tridosha), 
Samskara (mode of 
processing), Aharavirya (potency of food), Kostha (bowel habits) , Avastha (state of health), 
Krama (order of food intake), Parihara (restriction), Upachara (prescription), Sanyoga 
(combination) , Hridya (delicious), Sampad (richness of quality)and Vidhi (rules of eating).Few 
contradictory combinations mentioned in the classics are fish or its soup along with milk, milk 
or milk products with alcoholic beverages , radish consumed with milk and lotus stem with 
honey etc.
3. Concept of Vihara (Lifestyle)
The Dinacharya, Ritucharya and Sadvritta are parts of correct/ideal Lifestyle measures 
mentioned in Ayurvedic classics for maintenance of health and also to achieve a long, healthy 
active life, providing relief from pain and disease. Detailed description of personal hygiene 
encompass diet and regimen during daily routine (Dinacharya), seasonal routine (Ritucharya) 
and behavioral, rules of good conduct (Sadvritta) and description of suppressible (Dhamiya 
vega) & non suppressible(Adhamiya vega) urges is available in Ayurveda.

Abstain from those factors which cause mental agony:-It is not what you eat that kills you; 
it is what eats you (negative thoughts) that kills you. (Hippsley-Cox J, Fielding K, and Pringle 
M. Depression as a risk factor for IHD in men). There are a host of scientific studies, both 
prospective and retrospective, that have shown a very close cause-effect relationship between 
negative thoughts like anger, pride, hostility, and depression and vascular diseases and, even, 
cancer!.
3.1 Dinacharya (Daily regimen)
• 
It is advisable to wake up during Brahma Muhurta (preferably between 4.00 a.m. to 5.30
a.m.).
• 
One should attend the nature’s calls.
• 
The soft brushes made out of twigs of Khadira, Karanja, Apamarga etc. should be used 
for brushing the teeth.
• 
Tongue should be cleaned by a long flexible strip of metal or plant twig. It not only 
cleanses the tongue but also stimulates digestion. Mouth should also be cleaned properly.
• 
Chewing of betel leaves with small pieces of Areca nut (Khadira) and fragrant substances 
like cardamom, cloves, refreshes the mouth and enhance digestion.
• 
It is necessary to massage (Abhyanga) whole body with oil every day. Oil massage ensures 
softness and unctuousness of skin, free movement of joints and muscles, peripheral 
circulation and elimination of metabolic wastes.
• 
Regular exercise (Vyayama) is essential for perfect health. It builds up stamina and 
resistance against disease, clears the channels of body (Srotas) and increases the blood 
circulation. It enhances efficiency of body organs, promotes appetite and digestion and 
prevents obesity.
• 
Whole body massage with dry powders of yava,kola & kulath (Udvartana) every day.
• 
Bathing (Snana) improves enthusiasm, strength, sexual vigour, appetite, span of life and 
removes sweat and other impurities from the body. After bath one should wear clean 
clothes and smear the body with perfume.
• 
One should have regular shaving, haircut (Kshaura Karma), cutting of nails (Nakh 
apkartana) etc.
3.2 Rithucharya (Seasonal regimen)
In Ayurvedic classics, there has been a thorough consideration for seasons, besides 
the dietetic regimens for days and nights. Whole year is divided into six seasons and detailed 
dietetic regimen for these seasons is prescribed. In spring season, bitter, hot and astringent diet 
is advised while salty, sour and sweet food should be avoided. Wheat, barley, honey syrup, 
fruits like mango, jack fruit-etc. and meat of forest animals is advised. In summer season due to 
hot climate, aggravation of pitta occurs. Hence pitta pacifying cold, liquid, sweet and oily diet 
is advised. Excessive hot, spicy, sour salty diet should be avoided. Intake of rice, milk, ghee, 
sugar, grapes, coconut water, meat of forest animals are advised. In rainy season aggravation of 
vata occurs, hence vata shamaka sweet, sour and salty food and drinks are preferred. The food 
should be hot, dry, fatty and easily digestible.
1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI

Preserved rice, wheat, barley and mutton soups are advised. In pre winter and winter 
season Vatadosha aggravates due to cold, dry, chilly atmosphere in this season hence vataghna, 
pittavardhaka diet is recommended. Hot, sweet, sour and salty food, milk, sugarcane, rice, oils 
and fats are advised and in autumn season aggravation of Pitta dosha occurs. Therefore, it is 
ideal to take ghee processed with bitter drugs; purgation, bloodletting, coolant, and light diet are 
advised. Diets dominant in Bitter, sweet, pungent diets are advised ideal in this season.
3.3 Sadvritta (Rules of good conduct)
Ayurveda prescribes certain rules for maintaining healthy mind. These are principles 
of right conduct that are applicable to all people at all times and places. Practicing them gives 
balance and harmony to the mind. These are
• 
Whenever possible, devote your services to God, to the wise and to respectable or elderly 
individuals.
• Always speak the truth
• 
Do not lose your temper under any circumstances
• 
Do not get addicted to sensory pleasures.
• 
Do not harm anyone.
• 
As far as possible, do not expose yourself to hardships.
• Try to control your passions.
• 
Endeavor to speak pleasant and sweet words.
• Meditate every day for tranquility of mind.
• Observe cleanliness in all things.
• Be patient
• Observe self-control
• 
Try to distribute knowledge, good advice and help to others.
• Be straightforward and kind.

• 
Behave according to the time and place where you are residing.
• 
Act always in a courteous and polite manner.

and avoiding all that is bad.
3.4 Dharniya & Adharniyavega (Preventive Regimens)
Observations of certain prescriptions and prohibitions given by Ayurveda ensure physical, 
mental and spiritual well-being.

Non-Suppressible Urges
There are thirteen natural urges. Suppression of which leads to many diseases as given below:
• 
Suppression of urge for urination leads to difficulty in passing urine, urinary stone, 
atony of bladder and inflammation of urinary tract.
• 
Suppression of urge for passing stool leads to pain in abdomen, indigestion, gas in 
abdomen, headache.
• 
Suppression of flatus leads to pain in abdomen, indigestion, heart diseases, constipation 
or diarrhea.
• 
Suppression of ejaculation of semen may produce a stone (Spermato-lith), pain in testis 
and difficulty in intercourse.
• 
Suppression of vomiting produces different types of diseases like urticaria, giddiness, 
anaemia, hyperacidity, skin diseases and fever.
• 
Suppression of sneezing may produce rhinitis and chronic cold, headache, sinusitis and 
diseases of respiratory system.
• 
Suppression of eructation leads to hiccough, pain in chest, cough and loss of appetite.
• 
Suppression of yawning leads to diseases of the eyes, throat, ear and nose.
• 
Suppression of hunger and thirst may lead to nutritional disorders and debility.
• 
Suppression of tears leads to mental disorders, pain in chest, giddiness and digestive 
disorders.
• 
Suppression of respiration may cause suffocation, respiratory disorders, heart diseases 
and even death.
• 
Suppression of sleep causes the diseases like insomnia, mental disorders, digestive 
disorders and diseases of sense organs.
Suppressible Urges
One should suppress urges of greed, grief, fear, fury, pride, shamelessness, envy and
excessive passion. Observe self-control and always speak truth. One should not harm others
and should always act in a courteous and polite manner.
• 
Dietetic and behavioural bad habits should be given up and good' things should be taken 
up gradually. An intelligent person who seeks happiness should make a great effort to 
make good company and avoid the bad one.
4. Preventive Cardiology-An overview
More than 50% of the deaths and disability from heart disease and strokes, which together 
kill more than 12 million people each year, can be cut down by a combination of simple and cost 
effective national efforts and individual attentions to reduce major risk factors. 80% of all CVD 
deaths worldwide occur in developing, low and middle income countries. CVD has become one 
of the major leading causes of deaths in developing countries. It is estimated that 90% of CVD 
is preventable. Prevention of CVD involves improving risk factors through: healthy eating, 
exercise, avoidance of tobacco smoke and limiting alcohol intake.

As per Ayurveda, the food consumed by an individual is transformed in the intestinal 
tract by the action of koshtagni i.e, digestive fire. Production of ahararasa, which is normal 
in quality and quantity, depends upon the normalcy of koshtagni. The Rasa Dhatu is the 
first Dhatu which gets formed from the Ahara Rasa i.e. nutrient portion of food after proper 
digestion of food and is circulated by the action of vyana vayu throughout the body providing 
nutrition to seven dhatus, viz, Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Medas, Asthi, Majja and Sukra. The organs 
and channels through which this Rasa Samvahana (circulation) takes place are collectively 
termed as Rasavaha Srotas and Hridaya along with the ten Mula Dhamanis (great vessels) are 
considered as Mula (main organ) of this Srotas. In contrast, if the quality and quantity of Ahara 
and /or Kostagni are not in appropriate condition, it leads to improper digestion of food and 
subsequent formation of abnormal Rasa dhatu which has direct impact on Hridaya, the seat of 
Rasavaha srotas. In other words, the indiscretions followed by human beings in terms of Ahara 
(diet) and Vihara (lifestyle) can directly cause impairment of Agni and thus leads to formation 
of vitiated rasa dhatu. This vitiated rasadhatu is not capable of performing its normal functions 
of providing proper nutrition to seven dhatus in human body.
According to Ayurveda, excessive consumption of food which is heavy to digest, dry, 
cold and with bitter or astringent qualities, excessive physical exertion, altered patterns of 
sleep including day sleep, forceful withholding of urges or initiation of urges, excessive 
indulgence in purgation, emesis or enema procedures, mental stress, excessive fear, over 
thinking, anxiety and indulgences in medications to counteract these things can be broadly 
classified into Aharaja, Viharaja and Manasika factors which in turn vitiate the agni and 
subsequently the rasadhatu. The impaired rasadhatu in circulation, in presence of impaired 
agni at the levels of koshta and dhatus and vitiated vyana vayu, eventually paves the way for 
metabolic disorders such as medoroga, sthoulya, prameha etc which are milestones in the 
pathogenesis of hrid-vikara.
The common causative/predisposing factors for hridrogas as described in authoritative 
texts of Ayurveda are enumerated below so that these can be prevented for a healthy

below.

6.1 Madhumeha (Diabetes)
A condition characterised by excess (prabhut) elimination of turbid (avil) mutra( urine) is 
termed as prameha. Prameha is mentioned as Santarpanjanyavyadhi i.e. disease caused by over 
eating and sedentary lifestyle. Madhumeha (Diabetes mellitus) is mentioned as a special variety 
of Vataja Prameha. Acharya Sushrutha and Vagbhatta mentioned that if all pramehas when left 
untreated/not treated properly may eventually get converted to Madhumeha. Madhumeha is 
also termed as Ojomeha & Kshaudrameha.

etc (Nava annapana).
4. Excessive or regular intake of fried or oily food items.
