    "text": " the quest of man to have a happy life, through a deep understanding \nof evolution, creation and its maintenance, perceived and conceived by the rishi’s of ancient India. The \nprogressive establishment of scientific Ayurveda began in the Vedic period and has defined life as a manifestation \nof union of soul, mind and body those are integral and interdependent components of life. Ahara (wholesome \nfood), nidra (Optimum sleep) and brahmacharya (selective Celibacy) has been given pivotal role in the \nmaintenance of health. Along with diet, dinacharya and rtucharya has been given important role in the \nmaintenance of disease. Ayurveda describes the wholesome and non-wholesome substances including diet, \nmedicines etc. and has classified them into three major categories, viz, Shamana (palliative), Kopana \n(aggravating) and Swastha Hita (conducive to health).\nHuman body develops by assimilating nutrients from food. Wholesome food is the cause for excellence in \nhealth and unwholesome is responsible for disease. Ayurveda has developed the wisdom of dietetics on the \nbasis of various natural perceptions at different levels of our sensorium. Ahara (wholesome food), Vihara \n(wholesome activities) and Aushadha (medicaments) form the cornerstone of palliative treatment.\nAnatomy and physiology of skin has been dealt in detail by Ayurveda. The diseases of skin often mirror the \nin-equilibrium of dosha in the body as skin represents the substratum upon which the quality of ahararasa, \nwhich is obtained from Ahara, is depicted upon. The ICD-10 classification of human disease lists more than\n1,000 skin or skin-related illnesses, a pattern dominated by a few conditions accounting for most of the skin \ndisease burden. Despite this profound impact, skin disease continues to receive relatively little attention in the \nnational or global health debate. Collectively, skin conditions were the 4th leading cause of nonfatal burden \nexpressed as years lost due to disability in 2010.\nAyurveda has included skin diseases under the umbrella of Kushta and has pointed at its multifactorial \netiology. Erroneous Diet and lifestyle have been implicated as chief factors for the onset, progression and \nrecurrence of many skin diseases.

Skin also regulates \nbody temperature, gathers sensory inputs from the environment, stores water, fat, and vitamin D, and plays a role in \nthe immune system protecting from the disease. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and protects the \nbody from the environment. The thickness of the epidermis varies in different types of skin; it is only .05 mm thick on \nthe eyelids, and is 1.5 mm thick on the palms and the soles of the feet. The dermis is located beneath the epidermis \nand is the thickest of the three layers of the skin (1.5 to 4 mm thick), making up approximately 90 percent of the \nthickness of the skin. The main functions of the dermis are to regulate teFmperature and to supply the epidermis with \nnutrient-saturated blood. Much of the body’s water supply is stored within the dermis. This layer contains most of the \nskins’ specialized cells and structures, including lymphatic’s, blood vessels, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, collagen, \nelastin and nerve endings. The hypodermis (subcutaneous layer, or superficial fascia) lies between the dermis and \nunderlying tissues and organs. It consists of mostly adipose tissue and is the storage site of most body fat.\nAyurveda explains twak as one among the 5 jnanendriya, attributed with the function of sensation of touch and is the \nlocation (ashray sthana) of sweat channels (swedavahi strotas) and hairs (loma). Susrutha and Bhavamishra'have \nopined that twak has 7 layers, while Vagbhatta and Charaka have described 6 layers of twak as tabulated below.\nTable 1: 7 layers of Twak (skin) as explained by Ayurveda.\nName of different \nLayer\nWidth\n(thickness)\nRogadhisthan \n(site of skin diseases)\nModern concept\nAvabhasini/\nUdakdhara\n1/18 vrihi\nSidhma, Padmakantaka\nEpithelial layer, horny \nlayer, Stratum \nCorneum\nLohita/Asrugdhara\n1/16 vrihi\nTilkalak, Nyachchha, Vyang\n",

Silently (moun)\n\nAhara matra (quantity of food)\nThe food and nutritional requirement varies from person to person and depends upon the status of agni, sharira \nprakriti, age etc. Susruta and Vagbhata have suggested that if stomach capacity is hypothetically divided into 4 \nparts on the basis of its filling , one should take 2 parts of solid food, 1 part of liquid food and 1 part should be \nleft empty for easy movement of Vata4.\nSequence of food intake\nGuru, madhura and snigdha food should be taken initially during the course of a meal followed by amla, lavana \nahara. Food which is ruksha, katu, tikta and kashaya should be taken in the last part of the meal for proper \nactivation of agni, proper absorption and assimilation of food. After taking food, it is advised to take rest for \nmuhurta matra (48 minutes)5 for proper digestion.\nAhara vidhi viseshaayatana\nTo receive the total benefits of Ahara it is also necessary to have the knowledge about” Ashta ahara \nvidhivisheshaayatana”.they are\n1. Prakriti-food should be taken considering the nature of food, such as guru (Heavy food like \nmilk, flesh), laghu (food like green gram etc which are light to digest) , seeta (food which are \ncold in potency such as milk) , ushna (food which are of hot potency like spicy food), ruksha \n(dry ness inducing food), snigda( unctuous food such as ghee, butter) and their impact on agni .\n2. Karana- It refers to modification in the food property by action of agni, water etc. dadhi is a \nsubstance which is prohibited to be used after heating.\n3.

Acharya Charaka \ndefines virudhahara as certain diet and its combinations, which interrupts the metabolism, which inhibits the process \nof formation of tissue and which have opposite property to that of the tissue are called as ViruddhaAnna or \nincompatible diet7. Virudha can be considered as diet which are having mutually contradictory properties, \ncontradictory to tissues, diet capable of producing untoward effect on the body when processed in a particular \nform or proportion or those food which may produce an unwanted effect when taken at an inappropriate time. \nAyurvedic literature has compiled almost 18 types of virudha ahara and has also mentioned complications ranging \nfrom skin diseases (kushta), visarpa (erysipelas), unmada (insanity) and marana (death).\nConcept of Vihara (Lifestyle) in Ayurveda\nThe description about Dinacharya, Rtucharya, Sadvrtta and Nidra in Ayurveda clearly depicts the importance of \na healthy regimen in the prevention and management of many diseases. A growing body of scientific evidence has \ndemonstrated that lifestyle intervention is an essential component in the treatment of chronic disease that can be as \neffective as medication but considered to be safe without risks and side effects8.

It not only cleanses the tongue but also stimulates appetite and \ndigestion. Mouth should also be cleaned properly.\n• \nEyes should be cleaned with fresh water to prevent eye diseases and promote vision. Also wash eyes with \nTriphala Phanta every day.\n• \nChewing ofbetel leaves with small pieces of Areca nut (kramuka) and fragrant substances like cardamom, \ncloves, refreshes the mouth and enhance digestion.\n• \nIt is necessary to massage whole body with oil every day. Oil massage ensures softness and unctuousness \nof skin, free movement ofjoints and muscles, peripheral circulation and elimination of metabolic wastes.\n• \nRegular exercise is essential for perfect health. It builds up stamina and resistance against disease, clears \nthe channels of body (Srotas) and increases the blood circulation. It enhances efficiency of body organs, \npromotes appetite and digestion and prevents obesity.\n• \nBathing improves enthusiasm, strength, sexual vigour, appetite, span of life and removes sweat and other \nimpurities from the body. After bath one should wear clean clothes and smear the body with perfume. \nOne should have regular shaving, haircut, cutting of nails etc.\n\n• \nPerson should avoid extra marital sexual relationship and sexual intercourse with a woman during her \nmenses, pregnancy, within one and half month after delivery, devoid of passion, older than one and \nsuffering from disease.\nRitucharya (Seasonal regimen)\nIn Ayurvedic classics",

Whole year is divided into six seasons and detailed dietetic regimen for these seasons is prescribed. In \nspring season, bitter, hot and astringent diet is advised while salty, sour and sweet food should be avoided. \nWheat, barley, honey syrup, fruits like mango, jack fruit-etc. and meat of forest animals is advised. In summer \nseason due to hot climate aggravation ofpitta occurs. Hence pitta pacifying cold, liquid, sweet and oily diet is \nadvised. Excessive hot, spicy, sour salty diet should be avoided. Intake of rice, milk, ghee, sugar, grapes, coconut \nwater, meat of forest animals are advised. In rainy season aggravation of vata occurs, hence vata shamaka \nsweet, sour and salty food and drinks are preferred. The food should be hot, dry, fatty and easily digestible. \nPreserved rice, wheat, barley and mutton soups are advised. In pre winter and winter season Vatadosha aggravates \ndue to cold, dry, chily atmosphere hence vataghna, pittavardhaka diet is recommended. Hot, sweet, sour and \nsalty food, milk, sugarcane, rice, oils and fats are advised and in autumn season aggravation of Pitta dosha \noccurs. Therefore, it is ideal to take ghee processed with bitter drugs; purgation, bloodletting, coolant, and light \ndiet are advised. Diets dominant in Bitter, sweet, pungent diets are advised.\nSadvritta (Ethical Regimen): Rules of good conduct\nAyurveda prescribes certain rules for maintaining healthy mind. These are principles of right conduct that are \napplicable to all people at all times and places. Practicing them gives balance and harmony to the mind. These are\n• \nAlways speak the truth.\n• \nDo not lose your temper under any circumstances.\n• \nDo not get addicted to sensory pleasures.\n• \nDo not harm anyone.\n• \nAs far as possible, do not expose yourself to hardships.\n• \nTry to control your passions.\n•",

Ayurveda has given prime importance to ahara and vihara in the maintenance of health \nand prevention of diseases. In the recent past the relation between diet and skin ailments is well established in \ncontemporary medicine. Ayurvedic literature has described skin diseases mainly under the spectrum of kushta, \nthe literary meaning of which is that which cause disfiguration.\nAyurvedic system of medicine describes a wide range of etiological factors for dermatological disorders. The \netiological factors include physical, physiological, psychological, psychosocial, hereditary and Papakarma (sinful \nactivities), based on the proximity of causes which are reclassified into sannikrishta (proximal cause) and viprakrishta \n(remote cause) nidana\nSannikrista Nidana (real causative factor) - Three Doshas viz. Vata, Pitta and Kapha and four Dushyas viz. \nTvak (Rasa), Rakta, Mansa and Ambu or Lasika involved in the pathogenesis of skin diseases. These seven can \nbe considered as sannikrishta nidana in kushta",

Ill effect is thought to be transmigrated \nfrom past lives (Poorva Janmakrata)\nAccording to Sushruta if the person suffered from Kushtha in his previous life and if he takes rebirth then he \ndevelops Kushtha in his present life also Papakarma (sinful activities) has also been implicated in the etiology of \nkushta and is also said as a samsargja vyadhi (communicable disease). The Kushtha is generally described as \nTridoshaja Vyadhi but type of the Kushtha ascertained upon the predominance of particular Dosha and is generally \nclassified into mahakushta and ksudra kushta.\n\nNidana or the etiological factors closely linked with the manifestation, transmission and progression \nof the disease are broadly classified in the classical Ayurveda texts in the following categories:\n1. Aharaja nidana- food related causes\n2. Viharaja Nidana- regimen related causes\n3. Manasika Nidana- psychological causes.\n4. Visesha Nidana- an etiology that is not common in all diseases, but specifically act as hetu in this \ndisease.\n5.
