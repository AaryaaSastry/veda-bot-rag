To advocate preventive and curative measures \neach person has been identified on the basis of psychosomatic constitution \nin addition to the status of health. The diseases are classified according to \npsychological, physiological or extrinsic causes and are categorized on the \nbasis of their prognosis such as curable, incurable. Therefore the thorough \nexamination of the person, diagnosis of the disease including its severity \nand stage, understanding of his surroundings are very important before \nplanning the health care measures.\nThe Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences \n(CCRAS) is an autonomous body of the Department of AYUSH \n(Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy), \nMinistry of Health & Family Welfare, and Government of India. This is an \napex body in India for the formulation, co-ordination, development and \npromotion of research on scientific lines in Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa \nsystems of medicine. The Council has been carrying out several research \nstudies through its peripheral institutes spread all over India for the last \nmore than three decades. The findings of the research outcome are also \ndisseminated through various Research Journals, Technical Reports, \nMonographs etc. This booklet “Evidence Based Ayurvedic Practice” is",

The findings of the research outcome are also \ndisseminated through various Research Journals, Technical Reports, \nMonographs etc. This booklet “Evidence Based Ayurvedic Practice” is an \neffort to compile all such possible publications and present them in the \nform of a prescription for a particular disease condition, covering eighteen \ndiseases.\nThe target users of this document are mainly qualified general \npractitioners of Ayurveda but it will be useful to the students, researchers, \nacademicians also. The prescriptions mentioned in this booklet are limited \nto CCRAS research outcome only. Other than these, numerous \nprescriptions are prevalent in different regions, which are based on the \ntextual references, experience of the physician and community practices. \nTherefore the service provider will have too many other treatment options \nand the physicians may plan the treatment as per there logical decision on\n\nthe basis of the need of the individual. Most of the medicines mentioned \nhere are available in the market and the composition is provided for new \ncombinations. While prescribing the medicines or procedures the general \nguidelines mentioned in the booklet may be followed by the qualified \nhealth care provider.\nOver all, this document provides a selective list of certain \nprescriptions based on available research publications of CCRAS work. \nI acknowledge the efforts put in by all the contributors in bringing out \nthis compendium and hope it will be useful to the users.\nThe Council places the record of appreciation for inputs and \nsuggestions offered by Dr. Bharti, Assistant Director (Ay.), Dr. Sobaran \nSingh, Research Officer (Ay.-Scientist 4), Dr. B.

Anaemia is an indicator of both poor \nnutrition and poor health. It occurs at all stages of the life, but is more \nprevalent in pregnant women and young children. Iron Deficiency Anaemia \n(IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. Iron \ndeficiency can arise either due to inadequate intake or poor bioavailability \nof dietary iron or due to excessive loss of iron from the body. The poor \nbioavailability of dietary iron is considered to be major reason for \nwidespread iron deficiency",

The poor \nbioavailability of dietary iron is considered to be major reason for \nwidespread iron deficiency. Some other factors leading to Anaemia are \nintestinal parasites (hookworm etc.) and Malaria.\nAccording to Ayruveda, Pandu is characterized by pallor of the \nbody which strikingly resembles with Anaemia of modem science. \nCorrecting Anaemia often requires an integrated approach due to \nmultifactorial nature of this disease, in order to effectively combat it. The \ncontributing factors must be identified and addressed. In settings where \niron deficiency is the most frequent cause, additional iron intake is usually \nprovided through iron supplements. There are many age-old remedies for \nthe treatment of this condition in Ayurveda.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nThe following intervention/ approach are based on CCRAS research from \npublished sources.\nIn case of iron deficiency anaemia:1\nDhatri Lauha - 500mg twice a day after meal with warm water \nfor 45 days.\nReferences\n1. \nMonograph on Clinical Safety and Efficacy of Dhatri Lauha (A classical Ayurvedic \npreparation) in Iron Deficiency Anaemia {Pandu roga), Published by CCRAS, Year: \n2010.\nANAEMIA (PANDU)\n\nANAEMIA (PANDU)\nMEDICINAL PLANTS USEFUL IN \nANAEMIA (PANDU)\nDaruharidra (Berberis aristata)\nVidanga (Embelia ribes)\nAmalaki (Emblica officinalis)\nDadima {Punica granatum)\nYashthimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra)\n\nBRONCHIAL ASTHAMA\nt  \n(TAMAKA SHWASA) \n4\nBackground\nBronchial Asthma (Tamaka Shwasa) is prevalent all over the world.

Type\nII Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by variable degree of insulin \nresistance, impaired insulin secretion and increased glucose production. \nThe classical symptoms of Diabetes Mellitus are polyuria (frequent \nurination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger).\nMadhumeha has been vividly described in classical Ayurvedic texts. \nA number of predisposing and etiological factors and complications of this \ndisease are described in great detail.

Among them Wuchereria bancrofti is most common in India (98%). \nAccording to the estimates made in 1995 globally, there are nearly 1100 \nmillion people at the risk of Filariasis and there are 120 million cases of \nFilariasis. According to another study in India, the population exposed to \nthe infection was 25 million in 1953 and 420 million in 1995. India is the \nlargest Filariasis endemic country in the world. Now India contributes \nabout 40% of the total global burden of Filariasis and accounts for about \n5 0% of the people at risk of infection.\nFilariasis was well known to ancient Indians by the name of \nShlipada. It is described that the word Shlipada must be understood as an \nincrease in the size of the foot. The word 'Shlipada' is derived from \n“shilavat padam shlipadam”, where the limb/foot becomes hard like \nstone.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nThe following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS \nresearch from published sources.\nFor patients of acute shlipada who have symptoms of swelling with \nfever:1\ni.

There may be intermittent swelling with pain, \ndiscomfort and discharge of pus in the perineal region. This track does not \nheal usually due to fecal contamination, presence of unhealthy granulation \nand lack of rest to the part. This is a purely surgical condition but surgery has \nlot of complications and recurrence rate is also quite high after surgery.\nKsharasutra, a para surgical procedure and a unique technique \nadvocated by Ayurveda is described in Sushruta Samhita. Ksharasutra is a \nmedicated thread prepared by wetting the cotton thread with latex of Snuhi \n(Euphorbia nerifolia) and smearing it in the powder of Haridra (Curcuma \nlonga) and Apamarga (Achyranthes aspera) kshara followed by drying in \nspecially designed cabinet.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nKsharasutra procedure mentioned in the classical texts of Ayurveda was \nfurther developed after standardization and tried on large number of \npatients.

The wound should be dressed with medicated \noil/ghee and T-bandage should be applied. \nPatient should be \nadvised to have sitz bath with warm water after each defecation.

According to modem terminology, Hemiplegia is usually \nthe sequel of cerebro-vascular disorders or stroke and most cerebro-vascular \ndiseases are manifested by the abrupt onset of a focal neurologic deficit. The \nclinical manifestations of stroke are highly variable because of the complex \nanatomy of the brain and its vasculature. Other features are weakness, \ndecreased movement control, clonus, spasticity, exaggerated deep tender \nreflexes and decreased endurance. Hemiplegia is the leading cause of \ndisability resulting into enormous socio economic implications.\nThe terms Paksaghata, Paksavadha and Ekanga-roga are synonyms \nof the same disease and are used in classical treatises in various contexts. \nCharaka included it in the classification of Nanatmaja Vyadhi due to \npredominance of Vata Dosha.

Hypertension may develop during pregnancy \nalso.\nInAyurveda, the disease Vyanabala Vaishamya seems to be a result \nof the Vaishamya/ Vikriti of Vyanavata.

The incidence of malaria worldwide is \nestimated to be 300-500 million clinical cases each year and Malaria is \nestimated to kill between 1.1 and 2.7 million people worldwide each year. It \nis mostly caused by Plasmodium falciparaum. In India, during 2003 about \n1.65 million cases were reported with 943 deaths and there were 0.7 million \ncases of P. falciparum malaria.\nIn Ayurvedic literature Malaria fever is known as Vishama Jvara \n(intermittent fever) and many drugs are prescribed for its treatment.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nThe following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS \nresearch from published sources.

It is defined as a state of excess adipose \ntissue mass and is generally assessed on the basis of body mass index. \nObesity is more common among women. Globally the disease is prevalent \nin about more than 300 million adults worldwide (WHO World Health \nReport, 2003).In India, obesity is increasing at an alarming rate with \nmorbid obesity affecting about 5% of the Indian population. People having \n'android obesity' (abdominal fat distribution) are at increased risk from \nthose having 'gynoid obesity' (peripheral fat distribution around the body).\nAs per Ayurvedic concept, the excess accumulation of fat causes \npendulous movement of buttocks, belly etc. The obese person will suffer \nthe shortening of life span, difficulty in physical activity, difficult \ncopulation, general weakness, body odour, excess of sweating, excessive \nappetite and thirst.\nIntervention/ Approaches\nThe following are some interventions/ approaches based on CCRAS \nresearch from published sources.\nFor obese patients with hypercholesterolaemia and excessive sweat:1\nArogya Vardhini Vati - 720mg in divided doses for 3 months.\nFor obese patients with weakness and dyslipidaemia:2\ni Combination of Vacha (",

The pain of sciatic nerve originates \nfrom lower back and radiates towards buttocks, back of thighs, below the \nknee up to the foot. The pain is usually get worse on prolonged sitting, \nstanding and walking and relieved by lying down. The sciatica mostly \naffects the early and middle aged peoples, heavy weight lifters and persons \nwho are engaged in the occupations in which continuous pressure on back \nis used. The common causes of sciatica are herniated disc, spinal stenosis, \nspondylolisthesis, piriformis syndrome, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and \nsometimes during pregnancy. As the sciatica is considered as a \nmanifestation of underlying diseases, the line of treatment is to treat \nunderlying cause which irritate/ compress the sciatic nerve. Besides this, \nbed rest, physiotherapy, analgesics and muscle relaxants are being used. \nSometimes surgical intervention may be required.\nIn Ayurveda, Gridhrasi (Sciatica) is considered as one of the \nimportant Vata Vyadhi (neurological disorders).
