WHO defines mental health as a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his \nor her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able \nto contribute to her or his community. Mental health is the foundation for effective communication, learning, \nemotions, thinking and self-esteem in an individual.

Mental \nillness is often used as an umbrella term for all diagnosable mental disorders involving significant changes in \nthinking, emotion and/or behavior and functional problems in family society and work place. \nStudies estimate that at least 10% of the world’s population is affected by mental illness and that \n20% of children and adolescents suffer from some type of mental disorder. A study reveals that 56 million of \nIndian population suffers from depression and 38 million suffers from anxiety disorders. A report of WHO on \ndepression reveals that almost 7.5% of Indian population suffers from major or minor mental disorders that \nrequire medical intervention. National Health survey of India reveals that “Every sixth Indian needs mental \nhealth help\nIn contemporary science, the insights of the gut-brain axis have opened a new dimension to the way \nwe understand and treat mental illness which has led to creation of budding branches such as ‘Nutritional \nPsychiatry’. Healthy gut function has been linked to normal central nervous system (CNS) function. Hormones, \nneurotransmitters and immunological factors released from the gut are known to send signals to the brain either \ndirectly or via autonomic neurons. However, Ayurveda has documented the ‘body-mind’ relationship aeons ago \n. Attempts to study mind in a scientific perspective was evident from the beginning of Vedic period itself. \nYajurveda has tried to describe mind as a media for perception and memory. Unmada has been recorded \nfor the first time in Atharva veda with its various stages and treatment. During the Samhita period, various \nAyurveda treatises had compiled the aetiology, pathology, symptomatology and management of Unmada.\nAyurveda \ndefines \nUnmada \nas \na \ncondition \ncharacterised \nby \nimpairment/vitiation \nin \nfaculties \nsuch \nas \nManas(mind), \nBudhi \n(Intellect). \nSanjna(Consciousness), \nGnana(Perception), \nSmrti(Memory),Bhakti(Inclination),Sheela(Character),Chesta(Behaviour) and finally, Achara (Conduct) \nwhich impairs the person’s life itself.

Further Ayurveda has detailed the influence of mind on bodily factors \nsuch as Ojas, Rasa Dhatu, Panchavidha Vata, Pachaka Pitta, Sadhaka Pitta,etc. and also the critical impact of \ndiet and regimen on it. There exists a two-way relationship between mental disorders and unhealthy behaviours \nsuch as unwholesome diet and unwholesome regimen, which in turn acts as contributing factors to diseases \nsuch as Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Obesity and Diabetes, and a range of other life-threatening disease \nconditions. Improvement in a population’s mental health will lead to improvement in its physical health – and \nwill help enhance overall social and economic welfare. The role of Ahara-Vihara in the nation’s mental health \nis yet to be fully understood and brought to the purview of health sector. \nToday, contemporary psychiatry still lacks access to the caverns of mind and its functional attributes. \nAetio-pathogenesis of many psychiatric diseases is still not unravelled and the management is often only \npartially effective in bringing the person back to socially and medically acceptable normalcy. Hence, \n\nconstructive role should be given to strengthening of mind, maintaining a healthy balance of emotions and \npreventing onslaught of psychological disturbance. Role of nutrition in healthy mind is one of the most under-\nvalued concepts in psychiatry. Brain requires different amounts of   complex carbohydrates, essential fatty \nacids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and water to remain healthy. In order to reduce the prevalence of mental \ndisorders, an integrated approach which synchronously reflects the interplay of biological, psychological, \nspiritual and social aspects of Psychiatry is needed.  This book is intended as a preventive and curative \nguideline in psychiatric disorders for physicians and common man alike. \n1.2 Concept of  health in Ayurveda\nLife according to Ayurveda is a conglomeration of the four interdependent components \nnamely, the body (Shareera), the sensory and motor faculties (Indriya), the mind (Satva), and \nthe soul (Atma). A healthy life necessitates a perfect complementary support of all these factors \nand thus the concept of health encompasses physical, mental, sensory and spiritual domains. \nIt is also indicated that a person",

Synonyms \nof Mana are Chitta, Chetas, Hrit, Hridd, Manas and Satva.\n“Chittam chetah hrdayam svantam hrnmanasam manah iti” (Amarakosha 1/4/3)\nMana is the entity through which the knowledge is obtained, which is closely related with Atma, through \nwhich one can perceive and the seat of Mana is Hridaya.\nMana is the superior analyzing faculty, the seat of soul or Atma and controls the whole body, by accommodating \nthe superior senses and can be said as the seat of knowledge. The proof of existence of mind is given by \nAyurveda is the existence of knowledge (Lakshanam Manaso Jnana). According to Vedanta Darshana, Manas, \nBuddhi, Chitta and Ahankara combine are called four Antahkarana (Internal instruments/Mechanism). \nManas is told as ‘Ubhayatmaka’ i.e. it is a dual faculty which has both sensory and motor functions and hence \nconsidered as a superior faculty because it controls and co-ordinates all other faculties connecting them with \nthe soul.\nIn contemporary psychology, mind is an all-encompassing umbrella term that covers the joint functioning of \nthe brain and body in conjunction with the memory, world view, personality, soul, and other intangible facets \nof human life and psychology. It covers the way a person interacts with people and the world, how they learn \nand express themselves and how they relate to abstract concepts such as religion, spirituality, metaphysics, \nand other areas of thought. The mind is the manifestations of thought, perception, emotion, determination, \nmemory, knowledge, conscience and imagination that take place within the brain.\n1.4 Location/Seat of Manas \nIt \nis \nconventional \nin \nAyurveda \nto \nattribute \nanatomical \nsites \nfor \nconceptual \nentities \nto \nprovide some concrete feature to abstract ideas.  ‘सत्वादिधाम हृदयम् स्तनोरः कोष्ठमध्यगम्’ \nAcharya Vagbhata says that the Hrudaya (heart) is the seat of Satva or Manas, likewise Acharya Charaka and \nS",

Brain can be said as the physical \nstructure upon which the attributes of mind are bestowed upon. Hence the brain and mind has an intimate and \ncomplex relationship. With the advance in research in fields of neurology, psychiatry, psychopathology and \npsychology and remarkably advanced tools of molecular biology, various links has been established on the \nrole of brain and neurotransmitters in Psychiatric conditions. \n1.5 Gunas (Properties) of Manas\nThe properties of Manas are ‘Anutwa’ and ‘Ekatwa’ i.e., subtlety and singleness or oneness.  Due to its \nsingleness, only single knowledge occurs at a time. Manas remains engaged in a particular sense organ and \ncannot perceive two or more objects at a time.  And its subtlety enables it to move rapidly from one object to \n\nanother by which it may appear that simultaneous perception of several objects is taking place. The inability to \nfocus on one thing or inability to withdraw from perception related to any particular Vishaya or object may be \nconsidered abnormal. Prolonged lingering on one thought may form the basis of obsessions and compulsions \nwhile inability to focus may be seen as symptom in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD), \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder, Depressive Diorder etc\n1.6 Karma (Functions) of Manas\nThe functions/actions of Manas has been described as Indriabhigraha (control of sense organs), Svasyanigraha \n(self-restraint), Uhya (hypothesis) and Vichara (consideration).

Swasyanigraha is self-control, restraining self from \ntemptations and affected by emotions. \n1.7 Arthas (Objects) of Manas\nThe objects, which are perceived through the sensory organs, are termed as Artha. Considering Manas as an \nindependent Indriya, it must have its own objects, which are experienced by the mind. Thus, besides being \ncapable of perceiving Indriya Visaya (sensory objects), Manas has the ability of experiencing its own objects \nlike anything that is thinkable. Thus the objects of manas are:\n Chintya - object of thinking about do’s and don’ts\n Vicharya – object of Reasoning, logic and discrimination\n Uhya – object of Judgment or guessing\n Dhyeya –object of continuous thinking about desired things\n Sankalpa – object of imagination and evaluation as to merit and demerit\nManas also functions introspectively without the relation to the sense organs. Any knowledge gained through \nthis method or emotions perceived by the mind also become the subject of thought. Sukha(happiness), \nDukha(unhappiness), Kama(lust), Krodha(anger), Bhaya(fear), etc., belong to this kind of knowledge. \n1.8 Mind as a cognitive Processor\nManas process the inputs from outside perceived directly or indirectly through sense organs and develop \nresponses by the interrelated activity of its attributes \nOrganization\nPattern \nRecognition \nAttention\nMemory \nProblem solving \nLanguage \nReasoning \nDecision \nmaking\nFig: 1: Various aspects of mind \n\n1.9 Faculties related with Manas\nDhee, Dhruti, and Smruti are the three main faculties, which are closely related to Manas. \nDhee: [Buddhi]“Buddhirhi Nischayatmika” \nThe function of Buddhi is decision-making or determination of input Manas places before it, as perceived \nthrough Indriyas.

In every individual; the cognitive, conative and affective aspects of \nthe mind is guided by the predominance of any of the three Gunas. \nAccording to Susruta, the predominance of either Satva guna or Mano doshas will show the following \ncharacteristics accordingly3. \nFig 3: Manogunas\nSattvika - Mercy, sharing nature, Endurance, Truthfulness, Good conducts, Belief in God, Knowledge, \nIntellect, Capacity to learn, Memory, Self-control/ dhruiti, and Selfless service. \nRajasika -Excess grief, moving habit, lack of self-control, inflated self-esteem, Lying nature, Cruelty, \nWickedness, Pride, Excitation, Attachment and Anger. \nTamasika - Depressed mood, lack of faith in God, lack of good conducts, intellectual deficits, ignorance, \ncrookedness, laziness and sleepiness. \nAll the positive attributes of the mind are due to the Satva constituent, and unwholesome activities are results \nof Rajas and Tamas constituents. These factors are responsible for the various behavioural patterns of human \nbeing.

Psychological suffering is often \nexpressed through somatic problems. In individuals with difficulty in recognising and expressing emotions, \nphysical manifestations are often seen in the form of loss of sleep, decreased/increased appetite, loss of libido, \nvague aches and pains in the body, fatigue, anger issues, eating disorders etc. Some physical diseases such \nas eczema, psoriasis, auto immune diseases, blood pressure etc are thought to be prone to worsen by mental \nfactors such as anxiety and stress. A person’s current mental state may affect how bad a physical disease is at \nany particular moment. Hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, Somatization disorder etc are believed to be \nrooted on mental problems. \nCertain chronic conditions and life threatening conditions such as Cancers, Renal Diseases etc also affect \nmind retrospectively in the form of anxiety, depression, worthlessness, feeling of rejection etc. \n5 Acharya Vidyadhar Shukla & Prof.Ravidutt Tripathi, Charaka Samhita, Vaidya Manorama Hindi Commentary,:Vimanasthana 5/12, page no.589, \nChaukhamba Sanskrit Pratisthan, Delhi.India 2006\n\nMind also can exert a positive or negative impact on the effect of treatment on body also. The positive impact \nof placebo on treatment is due to the effect of mind. The positive response of a patient to therapy is also guided \nby the innate positivity in the individual. \nThe concept of Satvavajaya Chikitsa in Ayurveda is centred on the mind by promoting positive vibes to the \nindividual. Ayurveda believes individual as a whole, encompassing body and mind together and treatment is \nalso aimed for both. \n1.15  Manas and Ojas\nOjas is the finest essence of the seven Dhatus (tissue elements).

It is also called Bala (strength) and body \nceases to exist in its absence. Ojas is closely related to the proper functioning of the various functions of \nthe body including that of the Manas. Ojas is depleted by mental emotions such as anger and grief and in \nconditions of its Kshaya, the person becomes fearful, worried and his faculties will not function properly. \nFainting, confusion, delirium and even death may occur if Ojas is highly depleted.6 A normal level of Ojas \nis conducive to the proper functioning of mind and the factors which are good for Manas will improve Ojas. \nThough Ayurveda has defined ‘Life’ in physical, mental and spiritual dimensions, the receptacles of diseases \nare related to Body and Mind only. Nature of Dosha vitiation (Shareera/Manasa) and symptomatology of \nmanifested illness lead to the categorisation as Somatic or Psychic diseases/disorders. However, body-mind \nexists as continuum. Further the basic cardinal entity that is responsible for the formation of body and thus \nhelping to create a conducive abode to the optimal functioning of mind is ‘Food’. Therefore along with the \nphysical health, mental health and illness also fundamentally depend on the wholesome or unwholesome food \nintake.\n1.16 Ayurvedic Psychiatry – pathological aspect \nBhootavidya \nThis is the branch of Ayurveda dealing with Psychiatric conditions and their treatment aspects.  The different \ndescriptions under this section are mainly characterized by gross behavioral abnormalities that are categorized \nand named according to the similarity of expression of their behavioural breakdown to those of the ‘Bhootas’ \nor living beings of mythological origin viz., Asura, Rakshasa, Pitru, Pisacha, etc. These terms have been \nmisconstrued widely and give Ayurvedic Psychiatry a superstitious outlook.  Here the word ‘Bhoota’ is used \nnot in the concept of spirits or demonic possession or the microbes causing infections, but in the concept of \n‘living beings’ that are clearly explained by Acharya Vagbhata  7i.e., the similarities shown in appearance, \nbehaviour, speech, posture, gait and other psychomotor activities to the characteristics of the respective \nBhootas",

Those \nwith Doshic predominance are included under Nija and hence their Nidana, Laksaņa and Samprapti are \nexplained on the basis of Doshas and are further divided into Vatika, Paittika, Kapahaja & Sannipatika.

A wide list of factors under Prajnaparadha has been \ndescribed in Ayurveda2 \nA person whose intellect, fortitude and memory are impaired, subjects himself to intellectual blasphemy \nby virtue of his bad actions leading to the aggravation of all Doshas.  In Charaka Samhita the causes of \nManovikaras like Irshya, Shoka, Bhaya, Krodha, Mana, and Dvesha are attributed to the defects in the \nintellectual or mental faculty of the person.  \nDue to Prajnaparadha the person is unable to delineate the good and bad and therby causing impairment \nin judgement.  He dreams and desires unattainable things, become too much attached to worldly things and \nlaments over their loss and fails in facing adverse situations.  Hence Prajnaparadha is considered as the root \nfor all the manifestations.3 \nThough many other etiological factors are mentioned under etiological factors of Mano Rogas, Charaka has \nclearly said that due to the Prajnaparadha of the person only, he is affected with mental illness.4  \nIt is due to Prajnaparadha that the ignorant indulge in unwholesome gratification of senses, suppression of \nnatural urges, exposure to strain beyond their capacity and adoption of temporary pleasing regimen. But the \nwise due to the clarity of vision do not fall into it. Observance of certain regimens may produce temporary \nunhappiness but in the long run leads to happiness.

The preventive \nand curative aspects of Ayurveda revolve around the central theme of Pathya Ahara and Vihara. Ayurveda \nemphasizes basic dietary guidelines in terms of appropriate food, combinations of food, methods of cooking, \nstorage, eating atmosphere, hygiene and etiquette (Ashtavidha Ahara Vidhi Visesha Ayatana) \nAyurvedic dietary guidelines include:\n1. \t Intake of food in time (Kale Bhojana).\n2. \t Food intake as per suitability (Satmya Bhojana)\n3. \t Food intake as per the prakruthi of individual (Hita Bhojan)\n4. \t Proper hygiene (Suchi Bhojan)\n5. \t Intake of food which is unctuous (Snigdha Bhojan)\n6. \t Intake of food which is warm (Ushna Bhojan)\n7. \t Intake of food which is easy to digest (Laghu Bhojan)\n8. \t Eat while there is interest to food and while eating concentrate on food and the process of eating (Tanmana: \nBhojana)\n9. \t Eat food with six taste components (Sad-Rasayukta Ahara)\n10. \tFood should be primarily sweet in nature (Madhura Praya)\n11. \tFood should be ingested calmly, neither too slow nor too fast (Na Ati Druta Vilambita)\n12. \tAfter bathing (Snatah)\n13. \tFood intake only when there is sufficient hunger (Kshudvan)\n14. \tProper washing of hand, feet and face should be done before food intake (Dhauta Pada-Kara-Anana:)\n15. \tAfter offering prayers and paying obeisance to gods and forefathers (Pithru -Deva Tarpana)\n16. \tAfter offering food to guests, teachers and chidren ( Athithi- Balakaguru",

Food which is Ruksha, Katu, Tikta and Kashaya should be taken in the last part of the meal for \nproper activation of Agni, proper absorption and assimilation of food. After taking food, it is advised to take \nrest for Muhurta Matra (48 minutes) for proper digestion.\nAhara vidhi viseshaayatana\nTo receive the total benefits of Ahara it is also necessary to have the knowledge about             “ Ashta Ahara \nVidhivisheshaayatana”.

A new branch called \ntopography (a science related to combination of food) is emerging, which tells about the combination of basic \ncategories of the food and their effects in the body\n2.4.Concept of Vihara (Lifestyle) in Ayurveda\nThe description about Dinacharya, Rtucharya, Sadvrtta and Nidra in Ayurveda clearly depicts the importance \nof a healthy regimen in the prevention and management of many diseases. A growing body of scientific \nevidence has demonstrated that lifestyle intervention is an essential component in the treatment of chronic \ndisease that can be as effective as medication but considered to be safe without risks and side effects. A \nlifestyle is a characteristic bundle of behaviours that makes sense to both others and oneself in a given time \nand place, including social relations, consumption, entertainment and such other behaviours.\n2.5  Dinacharya (Daily regimen)\nAyurveda promotes a lifestyle that’s in harmony with nature.\n• \t\nIt is advisable to wake up during Brahma Muhurta (preferably between 4.00 a.m. to 5.30 a.m.).\n• \t\nDrinking water early in the morning according to one’s capacity cleanses the body by enhancing the \nelimination of toxic wastes.\n• \t\nOne should attend the nature’s calls.\n• \t\nThe soft brushes made out of twigs of Khadira, Karanja, Apamarga etc. Tongue should be cleaned by a \nlong flexible strip of metal or plant twig.

Vegas can be said as the natural urges of the body which help the body in maintaining its internal \nhomeostasis by expelling the unwanted things. \nThe word ‘Vegadharan’ has two components Vega & Dharan. Vega means natural urge & Dharan is \nsuppression, thus Vegadharan means suppression of natural urges. Adharaniya vegas are the natural urges \nwhich should not be suppressed. Initiation of Vega is a normal body activity and is a process timely carried \nout by body at regular intervals & controlled by nervous system, suppression of which not only stops the \nelimination of waste products but also brings strain and disorders of nervous system causing many diseases. \nBy triggering an urge or suppressing an urge, Vata Dosha is being forcefully hampered and thereby leading to \nimbalance in the mind, which ultimately leads to psychosomatic diseases or purely somatic diseases. \n Dharaniya Vegas (suppressible urges) are Lobha (greed), Irshya (envy/jealousy), Dwesha (aversion), \nMaatsarya (competitive mentality), Raga (attachment).  Manasika vegas also include the other emotions like \nKama(lust), Krodha(anger), Bhaya (fear), Soka (grief), Chinta (anxiety). Excessive indulgence in Dharaneeya \nVega is the result of improper Atma-Indriya-Artha Samyoga and further impairs the synchrony of Manogunas. \nThus, one can understand that Manasika Vega is a result of vitiated Rajas and Tamas that cloud the mental",

The physical exercises (Asanas) may \nincrease patient’s physical flexibility, coordination, and strength, while the breathing practices and meditation \nmay calm and focus the mind to develop greater awareness and diminish anxiety, and thus results in higher \nquality of life. Other beneficial effects include, a reduction of distress, blood pressure, and improvements \nin resilience, mood, and metabolic regulation. It has been found in many researches that yoga have positive \neffects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like \nschizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.\nSome studies even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and \npsychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting \nlevels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier \nbalance of lipids and growth factors — just as other forms of exercise do.\n\nSection-D\n    4.1 CONTEMPORARY REVIEW OF ROLE OF NUTRITION IN PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. \nThe 20th century has seen major shifts in dietary intakes globally, with a marked increase in the consumption \nof sugars, snack foods, take-away foods and high-energy foods. At the same time, the consumption of nutrient \nand fibre-dense foods is diminishing. The very large body of evidence that now exists suggests that diet \nis important to mental health in the same way as it is to physical health. Feeding the brain with a diet that \nprovides adequate amounts of complex carbohydrates, essential fats, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and \nwater can support healthy neurotransmitter activity. It can protect the brain from the effects of oxidants, which \nhave been shown negatively to impact mood and mental health.\nDry weight of the brain is composed of 60% fat and hence the fat we eat may be directly affect the structure \nand substance of the brain.

    "text": " of Ashtanga Ayurveda, Psychiatry \nor ‘Bhootavidya’ has not developed into a mainstream system except in the certain regions of India. The \nmain reason being ignorance and obscureness prevailing around the concept of being afflicted with a mental \nillness, which is still considered a social stigma. Exploring its utility and developing its possibilities into a \ncomplementary support system to modern psychiatry is the need of the hour.  \nThe principles of Ayurvedic Psychiatry revolves around the concept of mutual inter relationship between the \n‘Psyche’ and ‘Soma’.  The psychic factors at large are influenced by the physical factors like food intake and \nactivities of daily life. The structural and functional components of the body viz, Dosha, Dhatu, Mala and \nOjas are nourished/maintained, depleted or vitiated by the influence of the Ahara and Vihara which becomes \nthe determinants of health and ill health. Reciprocally the status of ‘Satva’ is also indispensably affected by \nthese factors. The current statistics of psychiatric disorders also depicts the haphazardness of diet and regimen \nof modern life. In this regard Ayurvedic guidelines are of great relevance in the present era.     \nThese guidelines of Pathya Ahara and Vihara (conducive diet and regimen) work in different domains of \nintervention viz, Preventive, Curative, and Rehabilitative/ Supportive aspects. The ‘Satvavaisheshikakara \nBhavas’ or the decisive factors on the psyche of the future progeny holds prime importance in the pre-\nconceptional care. It reiterates the importance of prescribed diet and regimen in the couple for the best \npossible satva in the progeny. The sensory inputs, douhrida (longings during pregnancy), restricted activities \nand emotions etc are equally important in creating the psyche of the baby. The ‘Prasha’ or electuary in the \nnewborn and different sanskaras or ceremonies helps to prevent and check diseases.\nLong-term mental illness negatively affects the general health of the individual. The concepts of Sadvrita and \nAchara Rasayana help in the preventing derailment of mind. The concepts of Satvavajaya and Daivavyapasraya \ncan be used suitably in the form treatment modality and also in rehabilitation of the individual. \nThe streamlining of an inclusive society towards patients of psychiatric illness is necessary as a",
