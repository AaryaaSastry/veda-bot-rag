These evidences are further expanded and documented as \nclassical texts of Ayurveda such as Charaka Samhita, Susrutha Samhita, Astanga Sangraha etc. \nFurther in the medieval period, several new classics such as Bhavaprakasha, Shamgdhara \nSamhita, Chakradatta etc have expanded the scope, emphasizing on prevention and management \nof diseases through dietary and preventive interventions.\nAyurveda vividly describes the conducive and non-conducive substances including diet, \nmedicines etc and has classified them into three major categories, viz, Shamana (palliative), \nKopana (aggravating) and Swastha Hita (conducive to health). Ayurveda has also emphasized on \nthree major factors responsible for causation of any illness such as Asatmyendriyartha Samyoga \n(incompatible correlation of sense organs), Prajnaparadha (intellectual blasphemy) and \nParinama (disharmony with rhythms and cycles of nature); avoidance of which is essential for \nmaintenance of health and prevention of diseases.\nDetailed description concerning functional anatomy and physiology of Hridaya and associated \nillnesses are available in Ayurvedic literature. Hridaya (heart) is the mula (main seat) of \nRasavaha Srotas or circulatory system in the body. The vitiation of this system may lead to \ndiseases such as Sthoulya, Hridroga etc. The role of Vyana Vayu and Ojus which are major \nfunctional attributes also contribute significantly to the health and disease of cardio",

Background\nThe incidence of lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, \nand overweight/obesity associated with cardiovascular diseases is on the rise. Cardiovascular \ndisorders continue to be the major cause of mortality representing about 30% of all deaths \nworldwide. With rapid economic development and increasing urbanization of lifestyle in the past \nfew decades, prevalence of these diseases has reached alarming proportions among Indians in the \nrecent years. As Ayurveda is recognized as foremost life science and describes ways to prevent \nand manage lifestyle disorders, the world is being attracted towards its potential. Ayurveda \nprovides effective solutions in the forms of dietary regulation, lifestyle advisory, detoxification \nand bio-purification procedures like Panchakarma, since it targets preventive, palliative \nrejuvenative interventions and medicaments. The holistic approach of Ayurveda, treating the \npatient as a whole, meaning intervention targeted towards complete physical, psychological, \nand spiritual well-being makes this science a wonderful option in lifestyle disorders.\nBasically in Ayurveda, promotion of health and prevention of diseases is given more \nimportance than the treatment of the diseases. Health and diseases is dependent on three factors\n1.e. Ahara (Diet), Vihara (life style practices) & Oushadha (Drug& therapies). Among these, \nfood (Ahara) is considered as most important one. Pathya is defined as the ahara (diet) which \nis congenial to a person according to his constitution, appetite & digestive capacity of the body. \nMost health problems develop due to the wrong eating and improper cooking.

The planning \nof diet, based on certain principles mentioned in Astavidhi vishesayatan is very rational and \nscientific. Ayurveda emphasizes the characteristics of food in terms of quality, quantity and time \nwhich vary with age, constitution, habitat, digestive power, season, disease and also liking of \nthe patient. One has to consume the diet, which is suitable to him in all aspects, and deviation \nfrom these may cause diseases. In addition to these, wrong cooking procedures, irregular timing, \nand consuming imbalanced and non-congenial food and not following the prescribed rules for \npreparing, preserving and eating food may also cause imbalance of health. The proper intake \nof diet not only can prevent many health disorders but also plays major role in the management \nof diseases. Therefore, due consideration should be given to all aspects of diet- planning for \ntreatment of diseases and to maintain the health, according to Ayurveda.\nThe Ayurvedic regime of healthy life is designed for achievement of a long, healthy \nactive life, providing relief from pain and disease allowing enjoyment of life with attainment of \nsatisfaction & contentment. Elaborate description is available on personal hygiene encompassing \ndiet and regimen during daily routine (Dinacharya), seasonal routine (Ritucharya) and \nbehavioral and ethical principles (Sadvritta). Observance of certain rules regarding suppressible \nand non-suppressible urges also paves way towards positive health. Cardiac risk factors can be \nprevented or managed by lifestyle including principles of Dinacharya, Ritucharya and sadvrtta.\n2. Concept of Ahara (Diet)\nAny material in the universe, according to Ayurveda is composed of five basic elements, \nthe Pancha Mahabhootas, namely Earth (Prithvi), Water (Ap), Fire (Teja), Air (Vayu) and \nEther (Akasha) including human body and the food. Tridoshas i.e. Vata, Pitta & Kapha which \nconstitutes the body is also made up of Panchamahabhootas viz Vata is made up of Vayu and\n1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI",

Planning and indulging in the diet balancing these elements \nmaintain the homoeostasis of the body.\nEach dietary item may have dosha aggravating, dosha pacifying or dosha balancing \nactions in the body. Specific diet has been mentioned in Ayurveda to maintain the balance of \nDoshas disturbed due to various factors like season, age etc.The food contains six basic tastes \nand each taste has pre-dominance of particular elements of Pancha mahabhoota which exerts \nspecific effect on the Tridoshas & Dhatus.The Madhura (Sweet) rasa has predominance of \nPrithvi & Aap elements, Amla (Sour) rasa has predominance of Prithvi & Agni, Lavana (Salt) \nrasa has predominance of Aap & Agni, Katu (Pungent) rasa has predominance of Agni & Vayu, \nThikta (Bitter) rasa has predominance of Vayu & Akash and Kashaya (Astringent) rasa has \npredominance of Prithvi & Vayu. It is mentioned that, drugs having sweet, sour and salty taste \nalleviate Vata, those having astringent, sweet and bitter tastes alleviate Pitta and those having \nastringent, pungent and bitter tastes alleviate Kapha dosha.\nIn Ayurveda specific principles are described for consuming diet.

Regular physical exercise, not heavy \nexercise, keeps the body healthy, both by suppressing appetite after a while and burning extra \ncalories if needed.\n2.1 Viruddhahara (Dietetic Incompatibility)\nThe food with incompatible or contradictory qualities has poisonous effect on the body \nthat aggravates Tridoshas in turn leading to various disorders viz: Gulma (Lump), Allergies \nand Skin diseases. It also destroys strength, vigour, memory, immunity etc. The dietary \nincompatibility is due to Desha (climate), Kala (season), Agni (digestive power), Matra \n(quantity), Satmya (adaptability/customization), Doshas (tridosha), \nSamskara (mode of \nprocessing), Aharavirya (potency of food), Kostha (bowel habits) , Avastha (state of health), \nKrama (order of food intake), Parihara (restriction), Upachara (prescription), Sanyoga \n(combination) , Hridya (delicious), Sampad (richness of quality)and Vidhi (rules of eating).Few \ncontradictory combinations mentioned in the classics are fish or its soup along with milk, milk \nor milk products with alcoholic beverages , radish consumed with milk and lotus stem with \nhoney etc.\n3.

It not only \ncleanses the tongue but also stimulates digestion.

Whole year is divided into six seasons and detailed \ndietetic regimen for these seasons is prescribed. In spring season, bitter, hot and astringent diet \nis advised while salty, sour and sweet food should be avoided. Wheat, barley, honey syrup, \nfruits like mango, jack fruit-etc. and meat of forest animals is advised. In summer season due to \nhot climate, aggravation of pitta occurs. Hence pitta pacifying cold, liquid, sweet and oily diet \nis advised. Excessive hot, spicy, sour salty diet should be avoided. Intake of rice, milk, ghee, \nsugar, grapes, coconut water, meat of forest animals are advised. In rainy season aggravation of \nvata occurs, hence vata shamaka sweet, sour and salty food and drinks are preferred. The food \nshould be hot, dry, fatty and easily digestible.\n1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI",

In pre winter and winter \nseason Vatadosha aggravates due to cold, dry, chilly atmosphere in this season hence vataghna, \npittavardhaka diet is recommended. Hot, sweet, sour and salty food, milk, sugarcane, rice, oils \nand fats are advised and in autumn season aggravation of Pitta dosha occurs. Therefore, it is \nideal to take ghee processed with bitter drugs; purgation, bloodletting, coolant, and light diet are \nadvised. Diets dominant in Bitter, sweet, pungent diets are advised ideal in this season.\n3.3 Sadvritta (Rules of good conduct)\nAyurveda prescribes certain rules for maintaining healthy mind. These are principles \nof right conduct that are applicable to all people at all times and places. Practicing them gives \nbalance and harmony to the mind. These are\n• \nWhenever possible, devote your services to God, to the wise and to respectable or elderly \nindividuals.\n• Always speak the truth\n• \nDo not lose your temper under any circumstances\n• \nDo not get addicted to sensory pleasures.\n• \nDo not harm anyone.\n• \nAs far as possible, do not expose yourself to hardships.\n• Try to control your passions.\n• \nEndeavor to speak pleasant and sweet words.\n• Meditate every day for tranquility of mind.\n• Observe cleanliness in all things.\n• Be patient\n• Observe self-control\n• \nTry to distribute knowledge, good advice and help to others.\n• Be straightforward and kind.\n• Avoid irregularity in daily activities.\n• Avoid over eating, overdrinking, too much sexual activity, too much or too little sleep.\n• \nBehave according to the time and place where you are residing.\n• \nAct always in a courteous and polite manner.\n• Control your sense organs.\n• Make a habit of doing all that is good \nand avoiding all that is bad.\n3.4 Dharniya & Adharniyavega (Preventive Regimens)\nObservations of certain prescriptions and prohibitions given by Ayurved",

In contrast, if the quality and quantity of Ahara \nand /or Kostagni are not in appropriate condition, it leads to improper digestion of food and \nsubsequent formation of abnormal Rasa dhatu which has direct impact on Hridaya, the seat of \nRasavaha srotas. In other words, the indiscretions followed by human beings in terms of Ahara \n(diet) and Vihara (lifestyle) can directly cause impairment of Agni and thus leads to formation \nof vitiated rasa dhatu. This vitiated rasadhatu is not capable of performing its normal functions \nof providing proper nutrition to seven dhatus in human body.\nAccording to Ayurveda, excessive consumption of food which is heavy to digest, dry, \ncold and with bitter or astringent qualities, excessive physical exertion, altered patterns of \nsleep including day sleep, forceful withholding of urges or initiation of urges, excessive \nindulgence in purgation, emesis or enema procedures, mental stress, excessive fear, over \nthinking, anxiety and indulgences in medications to counteract these things can be broadly \nclassified into Aharaja, Viharaja and Manasika factors which in turn vitiate the agni and \nsubsequently the rasadhatu. The impaired rasadhatu in circulation, in presence of impaired \nagni at the levels of koshta and dhatus and vitiated vyana vayu, eventually paves the way for \nmetabolic disorders such as medoroga, sthoulya, prameha etc which are milestones in the \npathogenesis of hrid-vikara.\nThe common causative/predisposing factors for hridrogas as described in authoritative \ntexts of Ayurveda are enumerated below so that these can be prevented for a healthy\nI INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I\nheart.\n1.
